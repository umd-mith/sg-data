            <l> Monarch of Gods &amp; DÃ¦mons &amp; all Spirits </l>
            <l> But One, who throng those bright &amp; rolling Worlds </l>
            <l> Which Thou &amp; I alone of living things </l>
            <l> Behold with sleepless eyes{ } regard this Earth</l>
            <l> Made multitudinous with thy slaves, whom thou </l>
            <l> Requitest for knee-worship, prayer &amp; praise, </l>
            <l> And toil, &amp; hecatombs of broken hearts, </l>
            <l> With fear &amp; self contempt &amp; barren hope; </l>
            <l> Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,</l>
            <l> Hast thou made reign &amp; triumph, to thy scorn, </l>
            <l> Oer mine own misery &amp; thy vain revenge. . . . </l>
            <l> Three thousand years of sleep-unsheltered hours </l>
            <l> And moments, aye divided by keen pangs </l>
            <l> Till they seem years, torture &amp; solitude, </l>
            <l> Scorn &amp; despair--these are mine empire. </l>
            <l> More glorious far than that which thou surveyest </l>
            <l> From thine unenvied throne o Mighty God! </l>
            <l> Almighty, had I deigned to share the shame </l>
            <l> Of thine ill tyranny, and hung not here </l>
            <l> Nailed to this wall of eagle baffling mountain </l>
            <l> Black, wintry, dead, unmeasured{;} without herb </l>
            <l> Insect or beast, or shape or sound of life-- </l>
            <l> Ah me, alas, pain, pain ever forever! {SB}</l>
            <l> No change, no pause, no hope!--yet I endure</l>
            <l> I ask the Earth, have not the mountains felt?</l>
            <l> I ask yon Heaven--the all-beholding Sun</l>
            <l> Has it not seen{?} the Sea, in storm or calm</l>
            <l> Heaven's ever changing Shadow, spread below-- </l>
            <l> Have it's deaf waves not heard my agony? </l>
            <l> Ah me alas pain ever forever {SB}</l>
            <l> The crawling glaciers pierce me with the spears</l>
            <l> Of their moon-freezing chrystals, the bright chains</l>
            <l> Eat with their burning cold into my bones,</l>
            <l> Heaven's winged hound, polluting from thy lips</l>
            <l> His beak in poison not it's own, tears up</l>
            <l> My heart; &amp; shapeless sights come wandering by</l>
            <l> The ghastly people of the realm of dream{,}</l>
            <l> Mocking me &amp; the Earthquake-fiends are charged</l>
            <l> To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds</l>
            <l> When the rocks split &amp; close again behind;</l>
            <l> While from their loud abysses howling throng</l>
            <l> The genii of the storm, urging the rage</l>
            <l> Of whirlwind, &amp; afflict me with keen hail.</l>
            <l> And yet to me welcome is Day &amp; Night</l>
            <l> Whether one breaks the hoar frost of the morn,</l>
            <l> Or starry, dim, &amp; slow the other climbs</l>
            <l> The leaden-coloured East; for then they lead</l>
            <l> Thier wingless crawling Hours, one among whom{--}</l>
            <l> --As some dark Priest hales the reluctant victim--</l>
            <l> Shall drag thee, cruel King, to kiss the blood</l>
            <l> From these pale feet, which then might trample thee</l>
            <l> If they disdained not such a prostrate slave.--</l>
            <l> Disdain? ah no I pity thee--what Ruin</l>
            <l> Will hunt thee undefended thro wide Heaven!</l>
            <l> How will thy soul, cloven to its depth with terror</l>
            <l> Gape like a Hell within! I speak in grief</l>
            <l> Not exultation, for I hate no more</l>
            <l> As then, ere misery made me wise--the Curse</l>
            <l> Once breathed on thee I would recall. Ye mountains</l>
            <l> Whose many-voiced Echoes thro the mist</l>
            <l> Of cataracts, flung the thunder of that spell;</l>
            <l> Ye icy Springs stagnant with wrinkling frost</l>
            <l> Which vibrated to hear me, &amp; then crept </l>
            <l> Shuddering through India; Thou serenest Air </l>
            <l> Through which the Sun walks burning without beams, </l>
            <l> And ye swift Whirlwinds who on poised wings </l>
            <l> Hung mute &amp; moveless oer yon hushed abyss </l>
            <l> As thunder louder than your own made rock </l>
            <l> The orbed world--if then my words had power, </l>
            <l> --Though I am changed so that aught evil wish </l>
            <l> Is dead within, although no memory be </l>
            <l> Of what is hate--let them not lose it now! </l>
            <l> What was that curse? for ye all heard me speak {SB}</l>
            
	<speaker> FIRST VOICE: from the Mountains</speaker>
            <l> Thrice three hundred thousand years</l>
            <l> Oe'r the Earthquakes couch we stood;</l>
            <l> Oft as men convulsed with fears</l>
            <l> We trembled in our multitude. {SB}</l>
            <l> <speaker>SECOND VOICE: from the Springs</speaker></l>
            <l> Thunderbolts had parched our water,</l>
            <l> We had been stained with bitter blood</l>
            <l> And had ran mute 'mid shrieks of slaugter</l>
            <l> Thro' a city &amp; a solitude! {SB}</l>
            
	<speaker>THIRD VOICE: from the Air</speaker>
            <l> I had clothed since Earth uprose</l>
            <l> Its wastes in colours not their own,</l>
            <l> And oft had my serene repose</l>
            <l> Been cloven by many a rending groan {SB} And silence</l>

        <speaker>FOURTH VOICE: from the Whirlwinds</speaker>
            <l> We had soared beneath these mountains</l>
            <l> Unresting ages;--nor had thunder</l>
            <l> Nor yon Volcano's flaming fountains</l>
            <l> Nor any power above or under,</l>
            <l> Ever made us mute with wonder! {SB}</l>

        <speaker>FIRST VOICE</speaker>
            <l> But never bowed our snowy crest</l>
            <l> As at the voice of thine unrest-- {SB}</l>
            
	<speaker>SECOND VOICE</speaker>
            <l> Never such a sound before</l>
            <l> To the Indian waves we bore.--</l>
            <l> A pilot asleep on the howling sea</l>
            <l> Leaped up from the deck in agony</l>
            <l> And heard, &amp; cried--ah woe is me!</l>
            <l> And died as mad as the wild waves be {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}   THIRD VOICE </l>
            <l> By such dread words from Earth to Heaven</l>
            <l> My still realm was never riven</l>
            <l> When its wound was closed, there stood </l>
            <l> Darkness oer the Day{,} like blood. {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}   FOURTH VOICE</l>
            <l> And we shrank back--for dreams of ruin</l>
            <l> To frozen caves our flight pursuing </l>
            <l> Made us keep silence--thus--&amp; thus-- </l>
            <l> Though silence is as hell to us {SB}  they pass with a terrible sound</l>
            <l> {SD}   THE EARTH</l>
            <l> The tongueless caverns of the craggy hills</l>
            <l> Cried Misery, then the hollow Heaven replied</l>
            <l> Misery!  And the Oceans purple waves,</l>
            <l> Climbing the land, howled to the lashing winds.</l>
            <l> And the pale nations heard it,--Misery! {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD} PROMETHEUS </l>
            <l> I hear a sound of voices--not the voice</l>
            <l> Which I gave forth.--Mother thy sons &amp; thou</l>
            <l> Scorn him, without whose all-enduring will</l>
            <l> Beneath the fierce omnipotence of Jove</l>
            <l> Both they &amp; thou had vanished like thin mist</l>
            <l> Unrolled on the morning wind!--Know ye not me</l>
            <l> The Titan, he who made his agony</l>
            <l> The barrier to your else all conquering foe?</l>
            <l> O rock-embosomed Lawn{s} &amp; snow-fed stream{s}</l>
            <l> Now seen athwart frore vapours deep below,</l>
            <l> Thro whose oer-shadowing woods I wandered once</l>
            <l> With Asia, drinking life from her loved eyes,</l>
            <l> Why scorns the spirit which informs ye, now</l>
            <l> To commune with me--me alone, who checked--</l>
            <l> As one who checks a fiend-drawn charioteer-- </l>
            <l> The falshood &amp; the force of Him who reigns </l>
            <l> Supreme, &amp; with the groans of pining slaves </l>
            <l> Fills your dim glens &amp; liquid wildernesses? </l>
            <l> Why answer ye not, still? brethren!  {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}   THE EARTH</l>
            <l>							They dare not {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD} PROMETHEUS </l>
            <l> Who dares? for I would hear that curse again. . . .</l>
            <l> Ha, what an awful whisper rises up! </l>
            <l> 'Tis scarce like sound, it tingles thro the frame </l>
            <l> As lightning tingles, hovering ere it strike-- </l>
            <l> Speak Spirit! from thine inorganic voice</l>
            <l> I only know that thou art moving near</l>
            <l> And love. How cursed I him? {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}   THE EARTH </l>
            <l>	 					How canst thou hear</l>
            <l> Who knowest not the language of the dead? {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD} PROMETHEUS </l>
            <l> Thou art a living spirit--speak as they {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}   THE EARTH</l>
            <l> I dare not speak like life, lest Heaven's <del rend="overstrike">fierce</del> King</l>
            <l> Should hear, &amp; link me to some wheel of pain</l>
            <l> More torturing than the one whereon I roll.--</l>
            <l> Subtle thou art &amp; good, &amp; tho' the Gods</l>
            <l> Hear not this voice--yet thou art more than God</l>
            <l> Being wise &amp; kind--earnestly hearken now-- {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD} PROMETHEUS </l>
            <l> Obscurely through my brain like shadows dim</l>
            <l> Sweep awful thoughts rapid &amp; thick--I feel</l>
            <l> Faint, like one mingled in entwining love,</l>
            <l> Yet 'tis not pleasure {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}   THE EARTH</l>
            <l>	 				No, thou canst not hear</l>
            <l> Thou art immortal, &amp; this tongue is known</l>
            <l> Only to those who die . . . {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD} PROMETHEUS </l>
            <l>					{And what art thou}</l>
            <l> {O melancholy Voice?} {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}    THE EARTH </l>
            <l>					I am the Earth</l>
            <l> Thy mother, she within whose stony veins</l>
            <l> To the last fibre of the loftiest tree </l>
            <l> Whose thin leaves trembled in the frozen air </l>
            <l> Joy ran, as blood within a living frame </l>
            <l> When thou didst from her bosom, like a beam </l>
            <l> From sunrise, leap--a spirit of keen joy! </l>
            <l> And at thy voice her pining sons uplifted </l>
            <l> Their prostrate brows from the polluting dust </l>
            <l> And our <del rend="overstrike"><hi rend="underline">invisible</hi></del> Tyrant with fierce dread </l>
            <l> Grew pale--until his thunder chained thee here-- </l>
            <l> Then--see those million worlds which burn &amp; roll </l>
            <l> Around us; their inhabitants beheld </l>
            <l> My sphered light wane in wide Heaven, the sea </l>
            <l> Was lifted with strange tempest, &amp; new fire </l>
            <l> From earthquake-rifted mountains of bright snow </l>
            <l> Shook its portentous hair beneath Heaven's frown; </l>
            <l> Lightning &amp; Inundation vexed the plains</l>
            <l> Blue thistles bloomed in cities; foodless toads </l>
            <l> Within voluptuous chambers panting crawled; </l>
            <l> When Plague had fallen on man &amp; beast &amp; worm </l>
            <l> And Famine, &amp; black blight on herb &amp; tree, </l>
            <l> And in the corn, &amp; vines &amp; meadow grass </l>
            <l> Teemed ineradicable poisonous weeds </l>
            <l> Draining their growth, for my wan breast was dry </l>
            <l> With grief, &amp; the thin air, my breath, was stained </l>
            <l> With the contagion of a mothers hate </l>
            <l> Breathed on her child's destroyer--aye, I heard </l>
            <l> Thy curse, the which if thou rememberst not </l>
            <l> Yet my innumerable seas &amp; streams </l>
            <l> Mountains &amp; caves &amp; winds, &amp; yon wide Air </l>
            <l> And the inarticulate people of the dead </l>
            <l> Preserve, a treasured spell. We meditate </l>
            <l> In secret joy &amp; hope those dreadful words </l>
            <l> But dare not speak them {SB} {HL}</l>

            <l> All else who live &amp; suffer take from thee </l>
            <l> Some comfort; flowers &amp; fruits &amp; happy sounds </l>

            <l> They shall be told--. Ere Babylon was dust </l>
            <l> The Magus Zoroaster, my dead child </l>
            <l> Met his own image walking in the garden, </l>
            <l> That apparition, sole of men, he saw. </l>
            <l> For know there are two worlds of life &amp; death </l>
            <l> One that which thou beholdest, but the other </l>

            <l> The shadows of all forms that think &amp; live </l>
            <l> Till death unite them, and they part no more, </l>
            <l> Dreams &amp; the light imaginings of men </l>
            <l> And all that faith creates, or love desires, </l>
            <l> Terrible, strange, sublime &amp; beauteous shapes. </l>

            <l> From the tyrants banner torn </l>
            <l> Gathering round me, onward borne </l>
            <l> There was mingled many a cry</l>

            <l> Gleamed in the Night I wandered o'er--till thou o King of sadness</l>
