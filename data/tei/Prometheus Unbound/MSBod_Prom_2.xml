            <p rend="Plain Text"> From all the blasts of Heaven thou hast descended--</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Yes like a spirit, like a thought which makes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Unwonted tears throng to the horny eyes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And beatings haunt the desolated heart</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which should have learnt repose--thou hast descended</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Cradled in tempests thou dost wake o Spring</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> O child of many winds. . As suddenly</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Thou comest as the memory of a dream</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which now is sad because it hath been sweet;</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Like genius or like joy which riseth up</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As from the Earth clothing with golden clouds</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The desart of our life. . . .</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> This is the season this the day the hour,</p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> How like death-worms the wingless moments crawl!</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The point of one white star is quivering still</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Deep in the orange light of widening morn</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Beyond the purple mountains; through a chasm</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of wind-divided mist the darker lake</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Reflects it--now it wanes--it gleams again</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As the waves fade, &amp; as the burning threads </p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> Those eyes which burn thro smiles that fade in tears</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Like stars half quenched in mists of silver dew-- </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Beloved &amp; most beautiful, who wearest </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The shadow of that soul by which I live </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> How late thou art; the sphered {S}un had climbed </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The sea, my heart was sick with hope, before </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The printless air felt thy belated plumes. {SB}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Panthea</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Pardon, {g}reat Sister! but my wings were faint </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> With the delight of a remembered dream </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As are the noontide plumes of summer winds </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Satiate with sweet flowers. I was wont to sleep </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Peacefully, and awake refreshed &amp; calm </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Before the sacred Titan's fall, and thine </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Unhappy love, had made through use &amp; pity </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Both love &amp; woe familiar to my heart </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As they had grown to yours . . . erewhile I slept </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Under the glaucous caverns of old Ocean </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Within dim bowers of green &amp; purple moss; </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Our young Ione's soft &amp; milky arms </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Locked then as now behind my dark moist hair </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> While my shut eyes &amp; cheek were pressed within</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The folded depth of her life-breathing bosom . . . </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> But not as now since I am made the wind </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which fails beneath the music that I bear </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of thy most wordless converse; since dissolved </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Into the sense with which love talks, my rest </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Was troubled &amp; yet sweet--my waking hours </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Too full of care &amp; pain. {SB} {HL}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Asia</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">	 					Lift up thine eyes </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And let me read thy dream-- {SB} {HL}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Panthea</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">	 					As I have said</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> With our sea-sister at his feet I slept</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The mountain-mists condensing at our voice</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Under the moon, had spread their snowy flakes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> From the keen ice sh{ei}lding our linked sleep{.} . . .</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Then two dreams came. One I remember not.</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> But in the other, his pale, wound-worn limbs</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Fell from Prometheus, &amp; the azure night</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Grew radiant with the glory of that form</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which lives unchanged within, &amp; his voice fell</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Like music which makes dizzy the dim brain</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Faint with intoxication of keen joy:</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> {'}Sister of her whose footsteps pave the world</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> With loveliness--more fair than aught but her</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Whose shadow thou art--lift thine eyes on me!</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I lifted them--the overpowering light</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of that immortal shape was shadowed oer</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> By love; which, from his soft &amp; flowing limbs</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And passion-parted lips, &amp; keen faint eyes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Steam'd forth like vaporous fire; an atmosphere</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which wrapt me in its all-dissolving power</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As the warm ether of the morning sun</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Wraps ere it drinks some cloud of wandering dew.</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I saw not--heard not--moved not--only felt</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> His presence flow &amp; mingle thro my blood</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Till it became his life &amp; his grew mine</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And I was thus absorbed--until it past</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And like the vapours when the sun sinks down</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Gathering again in drops upon the pines</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And tremulous as they, in the deep night</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> My being was condensed, &amp; as the rays</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of thought were slowly gathered, I could hear</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> His voice, whose accents lingered as they died</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Like footsteps of far melody. . . . thy name,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Among the many sounds alone I heard</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of what might be articulate; though still</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I listened through the night when sound was none.</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Ione wakened then, &amp; said to me</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "Canst thou divine what troubles me to night</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "I always knew what I desired before</p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> "Whose spells have stolen my spirit as I slept</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "And mingled it with thine;--for when just now</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "We kissed, I felt within thy parted lips</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The sweet air that sustained me, &amp; the warmth </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "Of the life-blood for loss of which I faint </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Quivered between our intertwining arms"</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I answered not, for the Eastern star grew pale</p>

            <p rend="Plain Text">				Thou speakest, but thy words</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Are as the air. I feel them not. . . . oh lift</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Thine eyes that I may read his written soul. {SB} </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Panthea</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I lift them, though they droop beneath the load </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of that they would express--what canst thou see </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> But thine own fairest shadow imaged there {SB} </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Asia</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Thine eyes are like the deep blue boundless Heaven</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Contracted to two circles underneath </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Their long fine lashes--dark, far, measureless,--</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Orb within orb, &amp; line through line inwoven-- {SB}  </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Panthea</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Why lookest thou as if a spirit past? {SB}  </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text">  {SD}  Asia</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> There is a change, beyond their inmost depth</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I see a shade--a shape--'tis He, arrayed</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> In the soft light of his own smiles which spread</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Like radiance from the cloud-surrounded moon</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Prometheus it is {?thou}--depart not yet</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Say not those smiles that we shall meet again	</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Within that bright Pavilion which th{e}r beams	</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Shall build oer the waste world? the dream is told</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> What shape is that between us? its rude hair</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Roughens the wind that lifts it, its regard</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Is wild &amp; quick, yet 'tis a thing of air</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> For through its grey robe gleams the golden dew</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Whose stars the noon has quenched not. {SB} {HL}</p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> It passes now into my mind. methought</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As we sate here the flower-infolding buds</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Burst on yon lightning-blasted almond-tree</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> When swift, from the white Scythian wilderness, </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> A wind swept forth wrinkling the Earth with frost . . . </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> I looked, &amp; all the blossoms were blown down </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> But on each leaf was stamped--as the blue bells </p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> With shapes . . . methought among these lawns together </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> We wandered, underneath the young grey dawn </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Shepherded by the slow unwilling wind{s}; </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And the white dew on the new-bladed grass </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Just piercing the dark earth, hung silently-- </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And there was more which I remember not; </p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> The like was stamped as with a withering fire </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> A wind arose among the pines--it shook </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The clinging music from their boughs, &amp; then </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Low sweet faint sounds like the farewell of ghosts </p>
