            <l>Prometheus Unbound Act Two </l>
            <l>MS Shelley e. 1,2,3</l>
            <l>&lt;SCENE 1&gt; Act 2. Scene Morning--{a} <add>lovely</add> {V}ale in the Indian Caucasus--. Asia alone</l>
            <l>  {SD} Asia.</l>
            <l> From all the blasts of Heaven thou hast descended--</l>
            <l> Yes like a spirit, like a thought which makes</l>
            <l> Unwonted tears throng to the horny eyes</l>
            <l> And beatings haunt the desolated heart</l>
            <l> Which should have learnt repose--thou hast descended</l>
            <l> Cradled in tempests thou dost wake o Spring</l>
            <l> O child of many winds. . As suddenly</l>
            <l> Thou comest as the memory of a dream</l>
            <l> Which now is sad because it hath been sweet;</l>
            <l> Like genius or like joy which riseth up</l>
            <l> As from the Earth clothing with golden clouds</l>
            <l> The desart of our life. . . .</l>
            <l> This is the season this the day the hour,</l>
            <l> At sunrise thou shouldst come sweet sister mine. . .</l>
            <l> Too long&lt;del&gt;-&lt;/del&gt;desired too long delaying, come . . .</l>
            <l> How like death-worms the wingless moments crawl!</l>
            <l> The point of one white star is quivering still</l>
            <l> Deep in the orange light of widening morn</l>
            <l> Beyond the purple mountains; through a chasm</l>
            <l> Of wind-divided mist the darker lake</l>
            <l> Reflects it--now it wanes--it gleams again</l>
            <l> As the waves fade, &amp; as the burning threads </l>
            <l> Of woven cloud unravel in pale air. . . . </l>
            <l> Tis lost! &amp; through yon peak of cloudlike snow </l>
            <l> The roseate sunrise quivers--hear I not </l>
            <l> The eolian music of her seagreen plumes </l>
            <l> Winnowing the crimson dawn? {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea enters</l>
            <l>							I feel, I see</l>
            <l> Those eyes which burn thro smiles that fade in tears</l>
            <l> Like stars half quenched in mists of silver dew-- </l>
            <l> Beloved &amp; most beautiful, who wearest </l>
            <l> The shadow of that soul by which I live </l>
            <l> How late thou art; the sphered {S}un had climbed </l>
            <l> The sea, my heart was sick with hope, before </l>
            <l> The printless air felt thy belated plumes. {SB}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> Pardon, {g}reat Sister! but my wings were faint </l>
            <l> With the delight of a remembered dream </l>
            <l> As are the noontide plumes of summer winds </l>
            <l> Satiate with sweet flowers. I was wont to sleep </l>
            <l> Peacefully, and awake refreshed &amp; calm </l>
            <l> Before the sacred Titan's fall, and thine </l>
            <l> Unhappy love, had made through use &amp; pity </l>
            <l> Both love &amp; woe familiar to my heart </l>
            <l> As they had grown to yours . . . erewhile I slept </l>
            <l> Under the glaucous caverns of old Ocean </l>
            <l> Within dim bowers of green &amp; purple moss; </l>
            <l> Our young Ione's soft &amp; milky arms </l>
            <l> Locked then as now behind my dark moist hair </l>
            <l> While my shut eyes &amp; cheek were pressed within</l>
            <l> The folded depth of her life-breathing bosom . . . </l>
            <l> But not as now since I am made the wind </l>
            <l> Which fails beneath the music that I bear </l>
            <l> Of thy most wordless converse; since dissolved </l>
            <l> Into the sense with which love talks, my rest </l>
            <l> Was troubled &amp; yet sweet--my waking hours </l>
            <l> Too full of care &amp; pain. {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l>	 					Lift up thine eyes </l>
            <l> And let me read thy dream-- {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l>	 					As I have said</l>
            <l> With our sea-sister at his feet I slept</l>
            <l> The mountain-mists condensing at our voice</l>
            <l> Under the moon, had spread their snowy flakes</l>
            <l> From the keen ice sh{ei}lding our linked sleep{.} . . .</l>
            <l> Then two dreams came. One I remember not.</l>
            <l> But in the other, his pale, wound-worn limbs</l>
            <l> Fell from Prometheus, &amp; the azure night</l>
            <l> Grew radiant with the glory of that form</l>
            <l> Which lives unchanged within, &amp; his voice fell</l>
            <l> Like music which makes dizzy the dim brain</l>
            <l> Faint with intoxication of keen joy:</l>
            <l> {'}Sister of her whose footsteps pave the world</l>
            <l> With loveliness--more fair than aught but her</l>
            <l> Whose shadow thou art--lift thine eyes on me!</l>
            <l> I lifted them--the overpowering light</l>
            <l> Of that immortal shape was shadowed oer</l>
            <l> By love; which, from his soft &amp; flowing limbs</l>
            <l> And passion-parted lips, &amp; keen faint eyes</l>
            <l> Steam'd forth like vaporous fire; an atmosphere</l>
            <l> Which wrapt me in its all-dissolving power</l>
            <l> As the warm ether of the morning sun</l>
            <l> Wraps ere it drinks some cloud of wandering dew.</l>
            <l> I saw not--heard not--moved not--only felt</l>
            <l> His presence flow &amp; mingle thro my blood</l>
            <l> Till it became his life &amp; his grew mine</l>
            <l> And I was thus absorbed--until it past</l>
            <l> And like the vapours when the sun sinks down</l>
            <l> Gathering again in drops upon the pines</l>
            <l> And tremulous as they, in the deep night</l>
            <l> My being was condensed, &amp; as the rays</l>
            <l> Of thought were slowly gathered, I could hear</l>
            <l> His voice, whose accents lingered as they died</l>
            <l> Like footsteps of far melody. . . . thy name,</l>
            <l> Among the many sounds alone I heard</l>
            <l> Of what might be articulate; though still</l>
            <l> I listened through the night when sound was none.</l>
            <l> Ione wakened then, &amp; said to me</l>
            <l> "Canst thou divine what troubles me to night</l>
            <l> "I always knew what I desired before</l>
            <l> "Nor ever found delight to wish in vain</l>
            <l> "But now I cannot tell thee what I seek</l>
            <l> "I know not--something sweet since it is sweet</l>
            <l> "Even to desire--it is thy sport false {S}ister!</l>
            <l> "Thou hast discovered <del rend="overstrike"><hi rend="underline">some</hi></del>  inchantment old</l>
            <l> "Whose spells have stolen my spirit as I slept</l>
            <l> "And mingled it with thine;--for when just now</l>
            <l> "We kissed, I felt within thy parted lips</l>
            <l> The sweet air that sustained me, &amp; the warmth </l>
            <l> "Of the life-blood for loss of which I faint </l>
            <l> Quivered between our intertwining arms"</l>
            <l> I answered not, for the Eastern star grew pale</l>
            <l> But fled to thee {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l>				Thou speakest, but thy words</l>
            <l> Are as the air. I feel them not. . . . oh lift</l>
            <l> Thine eyes that I may read his written soul. {SB} </l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> I lift them, though they droop beneath the load </l>
            <l> Of that they would express--what canst thou see </l>
            <l> But thine own fairest shadow imaged there {SB} </l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l> Thine eyes are like the deep blue boundless Heaven</l>
            <l> Contracted to two circles underneath </l>
            <l> Their long fine lashes--dark, far, measureless,--</l>
            <l> Orb within orb, &amp; line through line inwoven-- {SB}  </l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> Why lookest thou as if a spirit past? {SB}  </l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l> There is a change, beyond their inmost depth</l>
            <l> I see a shade--a shape--'tis He, arrayed</l>
            <l> In the soft light of his own smiles which spread</l>
            <l> Like radiance from the cloud-surrounded moon</l>
            <l> Prometheus it is {?thou}--depart not yet</l>
            <l> Say not those smiles that we shall meet again	</l>
            <l> Within that bright Pavilion which th{e}r beams	</l>
            <l> Shall build oer the waste world? the dream is told</l>
            <l> What shape is that between us? its rude hair</l>
            <l> Roughens the wind that lifts it, its regard</l>
            <l> Is wild &amp; quick, yet 'tis a thing of air</l>
            <l> For through its grey robe gleams the golden dew</l>
            <l> Whose stars the noon has quenched not. {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Dream</l>
            <l>								Follow, follow! {SB}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> It is mine other dream-- {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l>	 				It disappears. {SB} </l>
            <l>  {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> It passes now into my mind. methought</l>
            <l> As we sate here the flower-infolding buds</l>
            <l> Burst on yon lightning-blasted almond-tree</l>
            <l> When swift, from the white Scythian wilderness, </l>
            <l> A wind swept forth wrinkling the Earth with frost . . . </l>
            <l> I looked, &amp; all the blossoms were blown down </l>
            <l> But on each leaf was stamped--as the blue bells </l>
            <l> Of Hyacinth tell Apollos written grief-- </l>
            <l> <hi rend="underline">O, follow, follow!</hi>  {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l>  {SD}  Asia</l>
            <l>	 				As you speak your words </l>
            <l> Fill, pause by pause mine own forgotten sleep </l>
            <l> With shapes . . . methought among these lawns together </l>
            <l> We wandered, underneath the young grey dawn </l>
            <l> And multitudes of dense white fleecy clouds </l>
            <l> Were wandering in thick flocks along the mountains </l>
            <l> Shepherded by the slow unwilling wind{s}; </l>
            <l> And the white dew on the new-bladed grass </l>
            <l> Just piercing the dark earth, hung silently-- </l>
            <l> And there was more which I remember not; </l>
            <l> But, on the shadows of the moving clouds </l>
            <l> Athwart the purple mountain slope was written </l>
            <l> <hi rend="underline">Follow, o follow</hi> as they vanished by, </l>
            <l> And on each herb from which Heaven's dew had fallen </l>
            <l> The like was stamped as with a withering fire </l>
            <l> A wind arose among the pines--it shook </l>
            <l> The clinging music from their boughs, &amp; then </l>
            <l> Low sweet faint sounds like the farewell of ghosts </l>
            <l> Were heard--<hi rend="underline">oh, follow, follow, follow me</hi></l>
            <l> And then I said Panthea look on me </l>
            <l> But in the depth of those beloved eyes </l>
            <l> Still I saw, <hi rend="underline">follow, follow. </hi> {SB} {HL}</l>

            <l> And Jove now reigned; for on the race of man</l>
            <l> First famine &amp; then toil &amp; then disease</l>
            <l> Strife, wounds, &amp; ghastly death unseen before</l>
            <l> Fell, and the unseasonable seasons drove</l>
            <l> With alternating shafts of frost &amp; fire</l>
            <l> Their shelterless pale tribes to mountain caves</l>
            <l> And in their desart hearts fierce wants he sent</l>
            <l> And mad disquietudes, &amp; shadows idle</l>
            <l> Of unreal good, which levied mutual war,</l>
            <l> So ruining the lair wherein they raged.</l>
            <l> Prometheus saw, &amp; waked the legioned hopes</l>
            <l> Which sleep within folded Elysian flowers,</l>
            <l> Nepenthe, Moly, Amaranth, fadeless blooms;</l>
            <l> That they might hide with thin &amp; rainbow wings</l>
            <l> The shape of death, and love he sent to bind</l>
            <l> The disunited tendrils of that vine</l>
            <l> Which bears the wine of life, the human heart;</l>
            <l> And he tamed fire, which like some beast of {?chase}</l>
            <l> Most terrible, but lovely, played beneath</l>
            <l> The frown of man, &amp; tortured to his will</l>
            <l> Iron &amp; gold, the slaves &amp; signs of power;</l>

            <l> Hidden beneath the mountains &amp; the waves </l>
            <l> He gave man speech, &amp; speech created thought </l>
            <l> Which is the measure of the Universe </l>
            <l> And Science struck the thrones of Earth &amp; Heaven </l>
            <l> Which shook but fell not; and the harmonious mind </l>
            <l> Poured itself forth in all-prophetic song, </l>
            <l> And music lifted up the listening spirit </l>
            <l> Until it walked, exempt from mortal care, </l>
            <l> Godlike, o'er the clear billows of sweet sound; </l>
            <l> And human hands first mimicked &amp; then mocked </l>
            <l> With moulded limbs more lovely than its own </l>
            <l> The human form, until till marble grew divine, </l>
            <l> And mothers, gazing, drank the love men see </l>
            <l> Reflected in their race--behold{,} &amp; perish-- </l>
            <l> He told the hidden power of herbs &amp; spings </l>
            <l> And Disease drank &amp; slept--Death grew like sleep,-- </l>
            <l> He taught the implicated orbits woven </l>

            <l> Changes his lair{s} {--}&amp; by what secret spell </l>

            <l> Gazes not on the interlunar {S}ea; </l>
            <l> He taught to rule, as life directs the limbs, </l>
            <l> The tempest-winged chariots of the Ocean </l>
            <l> And the Celt knew the Indian: Cities then </l>

            <l> The warm winds, &amp; the azure æther shone </l>
            <l> And the blue sea &amp; shadowy hills were seen . . . </l>
            <l> Such the alleviations of his state </l>
