            <l>Shelley MS e. 1,2,3</l>
            <l>&lt;SCENE 1&gt; Act 3d. Scene--Heaven. Jupiter on his throne Thetis &amp; The other Deities assembled--</l>
            <l> {SD}  Jupiter</l>
            <l>Ye congregated Powers of Heaven who share</l>
            <l> The glory &amp; the strength of him ye serve</l>
            <l> Rejoice{<del rend="overstrike">,</del>}! henceforth am I omnipotent</l>
            <l> All else has been subdued to me--alone</l>
            <l> The soul of man, like unextinguished fire</l>
            <l> Yet burns towards Heaven with fierce reproach &amp; doubt</l>
            <l> And lamentation &amp; reluctant prayer</l>
            <l> <del rend="overstrike">In tameless</del> insurrection, which might make</l>
            <l> Our antique empire insecure, though built</l>
            <l> On eldest faith, &amp; Hell's coeval, fear;</l>
            <l> And though my curses thro the pendulous air</l>
            <l> Like snow on herbless peaks, fall flake by flake</l>
            <l> And cling to it--though under my wrath's night</l>
            <l> It climb<del rend="overstrike">s</del> the crags of life, step after step,</l>
            <l> Which wound<del rend="overstrike">s</del> it, as ice wounds unsandalled feet</l>

            <l> Even now have I begotten, a strange wonder{,}</l>
            <l> That fatal child, the terror of the Earth,</l>
            <l> Who waits but till the destined Hour<del rend="overstrike">s</del> arrive</l>
            <l> Bearing from Demogorgons vacant throne</l>
            <l> The dreadful might of ever living limbs</l>
            <l> Which clothed that awful spirit unbeheld--</l>
            <l> To redescend <del rend="overstrike">&amp;</del> trample out the spark . . . {SB}</l>
            <l> Pour forth Heavens wine Idæan Ganymede </l>
            <l> And let it fill the dædal cups like fire </l>
            <l> And from the flower-inwoven soil divine </l>
            <l> Ye all triumphant harmonies arise </l>
            <l> As dew from Earth under the twilight stars; </l>
            <l> Drink, be the nectar circling thro your veins </l>
            <l> The soul of joy, ye everliving Gods </l>
            <l> Till exultation burst in one wide voice </l>

            <l> Griding the winds? from Demogorgon's throne-- </l>
            <l> Victory,! Victory!; feel'st thou not o World </l>

            <l> Or reassume, or hold succeeding thee . . .</l>

            <l> Even where he hangs, seared by my long revenge</l>
            <l> On Caucasus--he would not doom me thus--</l>
            <l> Gentle &amp; just &amp; dreadless is he not</l>
            <l> The monarch of the world--what then art thou?</l>

            <l> We two shall sink {o}n the wide waves of ruin</l>

            <l> Drop, twisted in inextricable fight;</l>

            <l> The conqueror &amp; the conquered, &amp; the wreck </l>
            <l> Of that for which they combated . . . Ai, ai, {SB} </l>
            <l> The elements obey me not . . . I sink . . . </l>
            <l> Dizzily down--ever, forever, down </l>
            <l> And like a cloud <del rend="overstrike">mine</del> the enemy above. . . . </l>
            <l> Darkens my fall with victory--ai! ai! {SB}</l>

            <l> Aye, when the strife was ended which made dim </l>
            <l> The orb I rule, &amp; shook the solid stars. </l>
            <l> The terrors of his eye illumined Heaven </l>
            <l> With <hi rend="underline">crimson</hi> sanguine light, thro the thick ragged skirts </l>
            <l> Of the victorious Darkness, as he fell; </l>
            <l> Like the last glare of day's red agony </l>
            <l> Which from a rent among the fiery clouds </l>
            <l> Burns far along the tempest-wrinkled Deep {SB}</l>
            <l>  {SD} Ocean</l>
            <l> He sunk to the abyss? to the dark void? {SB}</l>

            <l> On Caucasus{,} his thunder-baffled wings </l>
            <l> {E}ntangled in the whirlwind, &amp; his eyes </l>
            <l> Which gazed on the undazzling sun, now blinded </l>
            <l> By the white lightning, while the ponderous hail </l>
            <l> Beats on his struggling form which sinks at length </l>

            <l> Beneath the uplifting winds--like plains of corn </l>
            <l> Swayed by the summer air; my streams will flow </l>

            <l> Blue Proteus &amp; his humid Nymphs shall mark </l>
            <l> The shadow of fair ships, as mortals see </l>
            <l> The floating bark of the light-laden moon </l>
            <l> With that white star, its sightless pilots crest </l>
            <l> Borne down the rapid sunsets ebbing sea{;} </l>
            <l> Tracking their path no more by blood &amp; groans </l>
            <l> And desolation, and the mingled voice </l>

            <l> With azure calm out of the emerald urns </l>

            <l> Most glorious among Spirits, thus doth strength </l>

            <l> Fair sister-nymphs who make long years of pain </l>
            <l> Sweet to remember through your love &amp; care </l>
            <l> Henceforth we will not part. There is a Cave </l>
            <l> All overgrown with trailing odorous plants </l>
            <l> Which curtain out the day with leaves &amp; flowers </l>
            <l> And paved with veined emerald, &amp; a fountain </l>
            <l> Leaps in the midst with an awakening sound; </l>
            <l> From its curved roof the mountain's frozen tears </l>
            <l> Like snow or silver or long diamond spires </l>
            <l> Hang downward, raining forth a doubtful light;</l>
            <l> And there is heard the ever-moving air </l>
            <l> Whispering without from tree to tree, &amp; birds, </l>
            <l> And bees; and all around are mossy seats </l>
            <l> And the rough walls are clothed with long soft grass </l>
            <l> A simple dwelling, which shall be our own </l>
            <l> Where we will sit &amp; talk of time &amp; change </l>
            <l> As the world ebbs &amp; flows, ourselves unchanged-- </l>
            <l> What can hide man from Mutability?-- </l>
            <l> And <add>if</add> ye sigh, then I will smile, &amp; thou </l>
            <l> Ione, shall chant fragments of sea-music{,} </l>
            <l> Until I weep, when ye shall smile away </l>
            <l> The tears she brought, which yet were sweet to shed; </l>
            <l> We will entangle buds &amp; flowers, &amp; beams </l>
            <l> Which twinkle on the fountain's brim and make </l>
            <l> Strange combinations out of common things </l>
            <l> Like human babes in their brief innocence </l>
            <l> And we will search, with looks &amp; words of love </l>
            <l> For hidden thoughts each lovelier than the last </l>
            <l> Our unexhausted spirits, and like lutes </l>
            <l> Touched by the skill of the enamoured wind </l>
            <l> Weave harmonies divine, yet ever new, </l>
            <l> From difference sweet where discord cannot be. </l>
            <l> And thither come, sped on the charmed winds </l>
            <l> Which meet from all the points of Heaven, as bees </l>
            <l> From every flower aerial Enna feeds </l>
            <l> At their known island-homes in Himera, </l>
            <l> The echoes of the human world, which tell </l>
            <l> Of the low voice of love, almost unheard </l>
            <l> And dove-eyed pity's murmured pain, &amp; music </l>
            <l> Iitself the echo of the heart, &amp; all </l>
            <l> That tempers or improves man's life, now free </l>
            <l> And lovely apparitions dim at first </l>
            <l> Then radiant, as the mind, arising bright </l>
            <l> From the embrace of beauty, whence the forms </l>
            <l> Of which these are the phantoms, casts on them </l>
            <l> The gathered rays which are reality{,} </l>
            <l> Shall visit us, the progeny immortal </l>
            <l> Of Painting Sculpture &amp; rapt Poesy </l>
            <l> And arts, though unimagined, yet to be </l>
            <l> The wandering voices &amp; the shadows these </l>
            <l> Of all that man becomes, the mediators </l>
            <l> Of that best worship love, by him &amp; us </l>
            <l> Given and returned, swift shapes &amp; sounds which grow</l>
            <l> More fair &amp; soft as man grows wise &amp; kind </l>
            <l> And veil by veil evil &amp; error fall . . . </l>
            <l> Such virtue has the cave &amp; place around{.} turning to the spirit of the Hour </l>

            <l> A long long sound, as it would never end</l>
            <l> And all the inhabitants leapt suddenly</l>

            <l> I cannot tell my joy, when oer a lake, </l>
