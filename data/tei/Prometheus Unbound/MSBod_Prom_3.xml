            <p rend="Plain Text"> Soon as the sound had ceased whose thunder filled</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The abysses &lt;add&gt;of&lt;/add&gt; the sky, &amp; the wide earth;</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> There was a change . . . the impalpable thin air</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And the all-circling sunlight were transformed</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As if the sense of love dissolved in them</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Had folded itself round the sphered world.</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> My vision then grew clear &amp; I could see</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Into the mysteries of the Universe</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Dizzy as with delight I floated down</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Winnowing the lightsome air with languid plumes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> My coursers sought their birthplace in the sun</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Where they henceforth will live exempt from toil</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Pasturing flowers of vegetable fire--</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And where my moonlike &lt;add&gt;car will stand&lt;/add&gt; within</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> A temple, gazed upon by Phidian forms,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of thee, and Asia &amp; the Earth, &amp; me</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And yo{u} fair nymphs, looking the love we feel</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> In memory of the tidings it has borne</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Beneath a dome fretted with graven flowers</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Poised on twelve columns of resplendent stone</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And open to the bright &amp; liquid sky</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Yoked to it by an amphisbænic snake</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The likeness of those winged steeds will mock</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The flight from which they find repose--alas</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Whither has wandered now my partial tongue</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> When all remains unsaid which ye wd. hear!--</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As I have said I floated to the Earth</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> It was, as it is still, the pain of bliss</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> To move, to breathe, to be; I wandering went</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Among the haunts &amp; dwellings of mankind</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And first was disappointed not to see</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Such mighty change as I had felt within</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Expressed in outward things; but soon I looked</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And beh{o}ld! thrones were kingless, &amp; men walked</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> One with the other even as spirits do,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> None frowned, none trampled, hate disdain or fear</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Self-love or self-contempt on human brows,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> No more inscribed, as oer the gate of hell,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> "All hope abandon, ye who enter here"</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> None fawned, none trembled, none with eager fear</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Gazed on anothers eye of cold command</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Until the subject of a tyrants will</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Became, worse fate, the abject of his own</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which spurred him, like an outspent horse, to death-- </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> None wrought his lips in truth entangling lines </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which smiled the lie his tongue disdained to speak </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> None with firm sneer trod out in his own heart </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The sparks of love &amp; hope, till there remained </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Those bitter ashes, a soul self-consumed, </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And the wretch crept, a vampire among men </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Infecting all with his own hideous ill. </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> None talked that common, false, cold, hollow talk </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which makes the heart deny the &lt;hi rend="underline"&gt;yes&lt;/hi&gt; it breathes </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Yet question that unmeant hypocrisy </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> With such a self-mistrust as has no name{.} </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And women too frank beautiful &amp; kind </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As the free heaven which rains fresh light &amp; dew </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> On the wide earth, past; gentle, radiant forms </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> From customs evil taint exempt &amp; pure. </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Speaking the wisdom once they could not think </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Looking emotions once they feared to feel </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And changed to all which once they dared not &lt;del&gt;be&lt;/del&gt; </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Yet being now, make Earth like Heaven--nor &lt;del&gt;pri&lt;/del&gt; </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Nor jealousy nor envy nor ill shame </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The bitterest of those drops of treasured gall-- </p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Spoilt the sweet taste of the nepenthe love{.--} {SB}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Thrones altars judgement-seats &amp; prisons{;} wherein</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And beside which, by wretched men were borne</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Sceptres tiaras swords &amp; chains, &amp; tomes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of reasoned wrong glozed on by ignorance,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Were like those &lt;hi rend="underline"&gt;secret&lt;/hi&gt; &amp; barbaric shapes</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The ghosts of a no more remembered fame</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which from their unworn obelisks look forth</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> In triumph oer the palaces &amp; tombs</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Of those who were their conquerors, mouldering round</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> These imaged to the pride of Kings &amp; priests</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> A dark yet mighty faith, a power as wide</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> As is the world it wasted, and are now</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> But an astonishment{;} even so the tools</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And emblems of its' last {c}aptivity</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Amid the dwellings of the peopled Earth{,}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Stand, not o'erthrown, but unregarded now;</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And those foul shapes, abhorred by God &amp; {M}an</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which under many a name &amp; many a form</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Strange, savage, ghastly, dark &amp; execrable</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Were Jupiter, the tyrant of the world</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And which the nations panic-stricken served</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> With blood, &amp; hearts broken by long hope, &amp; love</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Dragged to his altars soiled &amp; garlandless</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> And slain amid men's unreclaiming tears</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Flattering the thing they feared, which fear was hate</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Frown, mouldering fast, oer their abandoned shrines{--}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The painted veil by those who were, called life,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> All men believed or hoped, is torn aside--</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The loathsome mask has fallen, the man remains</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed{:--}but man{:}</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Equal, unclassed, tribeless &amp; nationless</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Exempt from awe{,} worship, degree,--the King</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Over himself; just, gentle, wise{:--}but man:</p>

            <p rend="Plain Text"> Nor yet exempt, though ruling them like slaves,</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> From chance &amp; death &amp; mutability</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The clogs of that which else might oversoar</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> The loftiest star of unascended Heaven</p>
            <p rend="Plain Text"> Pinnacled dim in the intense inane.</p>
