            <l> {SD} Voice of unseen Spirits</l>
            <l> The pale Stars are gone,--</l>
            <l> For the Sun thier swift Shepherd</l>
            <l> To their folds them compelling</l>
            <l> In the depths of the Dawn</l>
            <l> Hastes, in meteor-eclipsing array, &amp; they flee </l>
            <l> 	Beyond his blue dwelling, </l>
            <l> 	As fawns flee the leopard . . . </l>
            <l> 	   But where are ye? {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  a <hi rend="underline">train of dark forms &amp; shadows passes by confusedly</hi>, singing--Panthea wakens </l>
            <l> 	Here oh here!</l>
            <l> We bear the bier	</l>
            <l> Of the father of many a cancelled year</l>
            <l> Spectres we</l>
            <l> Of dead hours be</l>
            <l> We bear Time to his tomb in eternity {SB}</l>
            <l> Strew oh strew</l>
            <l> Hair, not yew!</l>
            <l> Wet the dusty pall with tears, not dew!</l>
            <l> Be the faded flowers</l>
            <l> Of Deaths bare bowers</l>
            <l> Spread on the corpse of the King of Hours{!} {SB}</l>
            <l> Haste, oh haste!</l>
            <l> As shades are chased</l>
            <l> Trembling, by Day, from Heaven's blue waste{.}</l>
            <l> We melt away</l>
            <l> Like dissolving spray</l>
            <l> From the children of a diviner day{,}</l>
            <l> With the lullaby</l>
            <l> Of winds that die</l>
            <l> On the bosom of their own harmony {SB} {SD} <hi rend="underline">they vanish</hi></l>
            <l> {SD}  Ione</l>

            <l> {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> 	The past Hours weak &amp; grey</l>
            <l> 	With the spoil, which their toil</l>
            <l> 	   Raked together,</l>
            <l> From the conquest but One could foil {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Ione</l>
            <l> Have they past? {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l>				They have past</l>
            <l> They outspeeded the blast,</l>
            <l> While 'tis said, they are fled-- {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Ione</l>

            <l> {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> 	To the dark, to the past, to the dead. {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Voice of unseen Spirits</l>
            <l> Bright clouds float in Heaven,</l>
            <l> Dew-stars gleam on Earth,</l>
            <l> Waves assemble on Ocean,</l>
            <l> They are gathered &amp; driven</l>
            <l> By the Storm of delight, by the panic of glee{.} </l>
            <l> 	They shake with emotion-- </l>
            <l> 	They dance in their mirth{--} </l>
            <l> 	   But where are ye? {SB}</l>
            <l> The pine-boughs are singing</l>
            <l> Old songs with new gladness,</l>
            <l> The billows &amp; fountains</l>
            <l> Fresh music are flinging</l>
            <l> Like the notes of a spirit from land &amp; from Sea </l>
            <l> 	The storms mock the mountains </l>
            <l> 	With the thunder of gladness. </l>

            <l>    The voice of the Spirits of air &amp; earth</l>
            <l>    Have drawn back the figured curtain of sleep</l>
            <l>    Which covered our being &amp; darkened our birth</l>
            <l>    In the deep-- {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}  a Voice</l>
            <l>	 		In the deep? {SB} {HL}</l>

            <l>						Oh below the deep {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Semichorus 1.</l>
            <l>    An hundred ages we had been kept</l>
            <l>    Cradled in visions of hate &amp; care</l>
            <l>    And each one who waked as his brother slept</l>
            <l>    Found the truth-- {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Semichorus 2.</l>
            <l>	 			Worse than his visions were {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Semichorus 1.</l>
            <l>    We have heard the lute of Hope in sleep</l>
            <l>    We have known the voice of love in dream</l>
            <l>    We have felt the wand of Power, and leap-- {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Semichorus 2</l>
            <l>    As the billows leap in the morning beam {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Chorus</l>
            <l>    Weave the dance on the floor of the breeze,</l>
            <l> Pierce with song Heaven's silent light,</l>
            <l>    Enchant the Day that too swiftly flees</l>
            <l> To check its flight, ere the cave of Night; {SB}</l>
            <l>    Once the hungry Hours were hounds</l>
            <l> Which chased the Day, like a bleeding deer</l>
            <l>    And it limped and stumbled with many wounds</l>
            <l> Th<add>r</add>ough the nightly dells of the desart year {SB}</l>
            <l>    But now--oh weave the mystic measure</l>
            <l> Of music &amp; dance and shapes of light,</l>
            <l>    Let the Hours &amp; all Spirits of might &amp; pleasure</l>
            <l> Like the clouds &amp; the sunbeams unite {SB} {HL}</l>
            <l> {SD}  a Voice</l>
            <l>									Unite{!} {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> See where the Spirits of the human mind </l>
            <l> Wrapt in sweet sounds, like radiant veils, approach {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Chorus of Spirits</l>
            <l> 	We join the throng</l>
            <l> 	Of the dance &amp; the song</l>
            <l> By the whirlwind of gladness borne along;</l>
            <l> 	As the flying-fish leap</l>
            <l> 	From the Indian deep,</l>
            <l> And mix with the sea birds half asleep. {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Chorus of Hours</l>
            <l> Whence come ye so wild &amp; so fleet </l>
            <l> For sandals of lightning are on your feet </l>
            <l> And your wings are soft &amp; swift as thought, </l>
            <l> And your eyes are as Love which is veiled not{?} {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Chorus of spirits</l>
            <l> We come from the mind</l>
            <l> Of human kind</l>
            <l> Which was late so dusk &amp; obscene &amp; blind{;} </l>
            <l> 	Now tis an Ocean, </l>
            <l> 	Of clear emotion</l>
            <l> A Heaven of serene &amp; mighty motion. {SB}</l>
            <l> From that deep Abyss</l>
            <l> Of wonder &amp; bliss</l>
            <l> Whose caverns are chrystal palaces, </l>
            <l> 	From those skiey towers </l>
            <l> 	Where Thoughts crowned Powers</l>
            <l> Sit watching your dance, ye happy Hours {SB}</l>
            <l> From the dim recesses</l>
            <l> Of woven caresses</l>
            <l> Where lovers catch ye by your <del rend="overstrike"><hi rend="underline">loose</hi></del> {sliding} tresses{,}-- </l>
            <l> 	From the azure isles </l>
            <l> 	Where sweet Wisdom smiles</l>
            <l> Delaying your ships with her syren wiles {SB}</l>
            <l> From the temples high</l>
            <l> Of man's ear &amp; eye</l>
            <l> Roofed over Sculpture &amp; Poesy </l>
            <l> 	From the murmurings </l>
            <l> 	Of the unsealed springs</l>
            <l> Where Science bedews {her} DÃ¦dal wings {SB} </l>
            <l> Years after years</l>
            <l> Through blood &amp; tears</l>
            <l> And a <add>thick</add>  hell of hatreds &amp;  hopes &amp;  fears, </l>
            <l> 	We waded &amp; flew </l>
            <l> 	And the islets were few</l>
            <l> Where the bud-blighted flowers of happiness grew {SB}</l>
            <l> Our feet now, every palm,</l>
            <l> Are sandalled with calm,</l>
            <l> And the dew of our wings is a rain of balm;</l>
            <l> And beyond our eyes</l>
            <l> The human love lies</l>
            <l> Which makes all it gazes on, Paradise. {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Chorus of Spirits &amp; Hours</l>
            <l>    Then weave the web of the mystic measure;</l>
            <l> From the depths of the sky &amp; the ends of the Earth</l>
            <l>    Come, swift Spirits of might &amp; of pleasure,</l>
            <l> Fill the dance &amp; the music of mirth, </l>
            <l>    As the waves of a thousand streams rush by </l>

            <l> {SD}  Panthea</l>
            <l> But see, where through two openings in the forest </l>
            <l> Which hanging branches overcanopy, </l>
            <l> And where two runnels of a rivulet </l>
            <l> Between the close moss violet-inwoven </l>
            <l> Have made their path of melody, like sisters </l>
            <l> Who part with sighs that they may meet in smiles </l>
            <l> Turning their dear disunion to an isle </l>
            <l> Of lovely grief, a wood of sweet sad thoughts </l>
            <l> Two visions of strange radiance float upon </l>
            <l> The Ocean-like inchantment of strong sound </l>
            <l> Which flows intenser keener deeper yet </l>
            <l> Under the ground &amp; through the windless air {SB}</l>
            <l> {SD}  Ione</l>
            <l> I see a chariot like that thinnest boat</l>
            <l> In which the Mother of the Months is borne</l>
            <l> By ebbing light into her western cave</l>
            <l> When she upsprings from interlunar dreams,</l>
