<head>To Harriet</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Whose is the love that gleaming thro the world</l>
<l>Wards off the poisonous arrow of its scorn?</l>
<l rend="indented1">Whose is the warm &#38; partial praise</l>
<l rend="indented2">Virtues most sweet reward?</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Whose looks gave grace to the majestic theme</l> 
<l>The sacred, free &#38; fearless theme of truth</l>
<l rend="indented1">Whose form did I gaze fondly on</l>
<l rend="indented2">And love mankind the more?</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Harriet! on thine.--thou wert my purer soul</l>
<l>Thou wert the inspiration to my song</l>  
<l rend="indented1">Thine are these early wilding flowers</l> 
<l rend="indented2">Tho’ garlanded by me.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Then twine the withering wreath-buds round thy brow</l> 
<l>Its bloom may deck their pale &#38; faded prime</l>
<l rend="indented1">Can they survive without thy love</l> 
<l rend="indented2">Their wild &#38; moody birth?</l>

<head>A sabbath Walk</head>
<lg>
<l rend="indented1">Sweet are the stilly forest glades:</l>
<l rend="indented1">Imbued with holiest feelings there</l>
<l rend="indented1">I love to linger pensively</l>
<l rend="indented1">And court seclusions smile</l>
<l>This mountain labyrith of loveliness</l> 
<l>Is sweet to me even when the frost has torn</l>
<l>All save the ivy clinging to the rocks</l>
<l>Like friendship to a friends adversity!</l>   
<l rend="indented1">Yes in my souls devotedness</l>
<l rend="indented1">I love to linger in the wilds</l>
<l rend="indented1">I have my God, &#38; worship him</l>
<l rend="indented1">O vulgar souls more ardently</l>
<l rend="indented1">Than ye the Almighty fiend</l>
<l rend="indented1">Before whose throne ye kneel</l> 
</lg>
<lg>
<l rend="indented1">Tis not the soul pervading all</l>
<l rend="indented1">Tis not the fabled cause that framed</l>
<l rend="indented1">The everlasting orbs of Heaven</l>
<l rend="indented1">And this eternal earth</l>
<l>Nor the cold Christians blood staind King of Kings</l>
<l>Whose shine is in the temple of my heart</l>
<l>Tis that divinity whose work &#38; self</l>
<l>Is harmony &#38; wisdom, truth &#38; love</l>
<l rend="indented1">Who in the forests rayless depth</l>
<l rend="indented1">And in the cities wear<add type="insert" place="interlinear">y</add>ing glare</l>
<l rend="indented1">In sorrow, solitude &#38; death</l> 
<l rend="indented1">Accompanies the soul</l>
<l rend="indented2">Of him who dares be free</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="indented1">It is a lovely winters day.</l>
<l rend="indented1">Its brightness speaks of Deity</l>
<l rend="indented1">Such as the good man venerates</l>
<l rend="indented2">Such as the Poet loves</l>
<l>Ah! softly oer the quiet of the scene</l>
<l>A pealing harmony is felt to rise</l>
<l>The village bells are sweet but they denote</l>
<l>That spirits love by the clock, &#38; are devout</l>
<l rend="indented1">All at a stated hour. the sound</l>
<l rend="indented1">Is sweet to sense but to the heart</l>
<l rend="indented1">It tells of worship insincere</l>
<l rend="indented1">Creeds half believed, the ear that bends</l>
<l rend="indented1">To custom, prejudice &#38; fear</l>
<l rend="indented1">The tongue that’s bought to speak</l>
<l rend="indented2">The heart that’s hired to feel</l>
</lg>

  <lg>
<l rend="indented1">But to the man sincerely good</l>
<l rend="indented1">Each day will be a sabbath day</l>
<l rend="indented1">Consigned to thoughts of holiness</l>
<l rend="indented2">And deeds of lving love</l>
<l>The God he serves requires no cringing creed,</l>
<l>No idle prayers, no senseless mummeries</l>
<l>No gold, no temples &#38; no hirelng priests</l>
<l>The winds, the pineboughs &#38; the waters make</l>
<l rend="indented1">Its melody. the hearts of all</l>
<l rend="indented1">The beings it pervadeth, form</l>
<l rend="indented1">A temple for it’s purity</l>
<l rend="indented1">The wills of those that love the right</l>
<l rend="indented2">Are offerings beyond</l>
<l rend="indented2">Thanksgiving, prayers &#38; gold.</l>

  <head>The Crisis</head>
<lg>  
<l>When we see Despots prosper in their weakness</l>
<l>When we see Falshood triumph in it's folly</l>
<l>When we see Evil Tyrranny, Corruption</l>
<l rend="indented4">Grin, grow &#38; fatten</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>When Virtue toileth thro a world of sorrow</l> 
<l>When Freedom dwelleth in the deepest dungeon</l>
<l>When Truth in chains &#38; infamy bewaileth</l>
<l rend="indented4">Oer a worlds ruin</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>When Monarchs laugh upon their thrones securely</l>
<l>Mocking the woes which are to them a treasure</l>
<l>Hear the deep curse, &#38; quench the Mothers hunger</l>
<l rend="indented4">In her child’s murder</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Then may we hope the consummating hour</l>
<l>Dreadfully, sweetly, swiftly is arriving</l>
<l>When light from Darkness, peace from desolation</l>
<l rend="indented4">Bursts unresisted</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Then mid the gloom of doubt &#38; fear &#38; anguish</l>
<l>The votaries of virtue may raise their eyes to Heaven</l>
<l>And confident watch till the renovating day star</l>
<l rend="indented4">Gild the horizon</l>

<head>Passion<lb/>
(to the</head>  
<lg>
<l>Fair are thy berries to the dazzled sight</l>
<l>Fair is thy chequered stalk of mingling hues</l>
<l>And yet thou dost conceal</l>
<l>A deadly poison there</l>
<l>Uniting good &#38; ill</l>
</lg>
    <lg>
<l>Art thou not like a lawyer whose smooth face</l>
<l>Doth promise good, while hiding so much ill</l>
<l>Ah! no. the semblance even</l>
<l>Of goodness lingereth not</l>
<l>Within that hollow eye</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>Art thou the tyrant whose unlovely brow</l>
<l>With rare &#38; glittering gems is contrasted</l>
<l>No—thou mayst kill the body</l>
<l>He withers up the soul</l>
<l>Sweet thou when he is nigh</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>

<l>Art thou the wretch whose cold &#38; sensual soul</l>
<l>His hard-earned mite tears from the famished hind</l>
<l>Then says that God hath willed</l>
<l>Many to toil &#38; groan</l>
<l>That few may boast at ease?</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>

<l>Art thou the slave whose mercenary sword</l> 
<l>Stained with an unoffending brothers blood</l>
<l>Deeper yet shews the spot</l>
<l>Of cowardice, whilst he</l>
<l>Who wears it talks of courage!</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>Ah no! else while I gaze upon thy bane</l>
<l>I should not feel unmingled with contempt</l>
<l>This awful feeling rise:</l>
<l>As if I stood at night</l>
<l>In some <add type="unmarked" place="supralinear"><sic>wierd</sic></add><del type="overstrike">grey</del> ruins shade</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>Thou art like youthful passions quenchless fire</l>
<l>Which in some unsuspecting bosom glows</l>
<l>So wild so beautiful</l>
<l>Possessing wondrous power</l>
<l>To wither or to warm</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>

<l>Essence of Virtue blasting virtues prime</l>
<l>Bright bud of Truth producing Falshoods fruit</l>
<l>Freedoms own soul that binds</l>
<l>The human will in chains</l>
<l>Indissolubly fast</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>

<l>Prime source of all that’s lovely good &#38; great</l>
<l>Debasing man below the meanest brute</l>
<l>Spring of all healing streams</l>
<l>Yet deadlier than the gall</l>
<l>Blackening a monarch’s heart</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>

<l>Why art thou thus O Passion? Customs chains</l>
<l>Have bound thee from thine Heaven directed flight</l>
<l>Or thou wouldst never thus</l>
<l>Bring misery to man</l>
<l>Uniting good &#38; ill</l>
      </lg>

<lg>
<head>To Harriet</head>
<lg>
<l>Never O never shall yonder Sun</l>      
<l>Thro my frame its warmth diffuse</l>
<l>When the heart that beats in its faithful breast</l>
<l>Is untrue fair girl to thee</l>
<l>Nor the beaming moon</l>
<l>On its nightly voyage</l>
<l>Shall visit this spirit with softness again</l>
<l>When its soaring hopes</l>
<l>And its fluttering fears</l>
<l>Are untrue—fair girl to thee!</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>O Ever while this frail brain has life</l>
<l>Will it thrill to thy lovebeaming gaze</l>
<l>And whilst thine eyes with affection gleam</l>
<l>It will worship the spirit within</l>
<l>And when death comes</l>
<l>To quench their fire</l>
<l>A sorrowful rapture their dimness will shed</l>
<l>As I bind me tight</l>
<l>With thine auburn hair</l>
<l>And die as I lived with thee</l>
    </lg>

<head>Falshood &#38; Vice <lb/>a Dialogue</head>
<lg>
<l>Whilst Monarchs laughed upon their thrones</l>
<l>To hear a famished nations groans</l>
<l>And hugged the wealth, wrung from the woe</l>
<l>That makes their eyes &#38; veins oerflow,</l>
<l>Those thrones high built upon the heaps</l>
<l>Of bones where frienzied Famine sleeps</l>
<l>Where slavery with her scourge of iron</l>
<l>Stained in mankinds unheeded gore,</l>
<l>And wars mad fiends the scene environ</l>
<l>Mingling with shrieks a drunken roar</l>
<l>There Vice &#38; Falshood took their stand</l>
<l>High raised above the unhappy land</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<head>Falshood</head>
<l>Brother arise from the dainty fare</l>
<l>Which thousands have toil'd &#38; bled to bestow</l>
<l>A finer feast for thy hungry ear</l> 
<l>Is the news that I bring of human woe</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>

<head>Vice</head>
<l>And secret one, what hast thou done</l>
<l>To compare in thy tumid pride with me</l>
<l>I, whose career thro the blasted year</l>
<l>Has been marked by ruin &#38; misery</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>Falshood</head>
<l>What have I done! I’ve torn the robe</l>
<l>From baby Truths unsheltered form</l>
<l>And round the desolated globe</l>
<l>Worn safely the bewildering charm</l>
<l>My tyrant-slaves to a dungeon floor</l> 
<l>Have bound the dauntless innocent</l>
<l>And streams of fertilizing gore</l>
<l>Flow from her bosoms hideous rent</l>
<l>Which this unfailing dagger gave . . .</l>
<l>I dread that blood. No more. this day</l>
<l>Is ours. tho her eternal ray</l>
<l>Must shine upon our grave . . . .</l>
<l>Yet know proud Vice had I not given</l>
<l>To thee the mask I stole from Heaven</l>
<l>Thy shape of ugliness &#38; fear</l>
<l>Had never gained admission here</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>Vice</head>
<l>And know that had I disdained to toil</l>
<l>But sate in my noisome cave the while</l>
<l>And ne’er to these hateful sons of Heaven</l>
<l>GOLD, MONARCHY or MURDER given</l> 
<l>Hadst thou with all thine art essayed</l>
<l>One of thy games then to have played</l>
<l>With all thine overweening boast</l>
<l>Falshood, I tell thee thou had lost!—</l>
<l>But wherefore this dispute . . . we tend</l>
<l>Fraternal to one common end</l>
<l>In this cold grave beneath my feet</l>
<l>Will our hopes, our fears &#38; our labours meet</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>Falshood</head>
<l>I brought my daughter RELIGION on Earth</l>
<l>She smothered its sweetest buds in their birth</l>
<l>But dreaded Reasons eye severe</l>
<l>So the crocodile slunk off slily in fear</l>
<l>And loosed her blood hounds from the den</l>
<l>They started from dreams of slaughtered men</l>
<l>And by the light of her poison eye</l>
<l>Did her work oer the wide Earth frightfully</l>
<l>The deathy stench of her torches flare</l>
<l>Fed with human fat polluted the air</l>
<l>The curses, the shrieks, the ceaseless cries</l>
<l>Of the many mingling miseries</l> 
<l>As on she trod ascended high</l>
<l>And trumpeted my Victory!</l>
<l>Brother tell what thou hast done</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>Vice</head>

<l>Were <del rend="strikethrough">sat</del>ed in that joyous hour</l>
<l>Which searchless fate had stampt for me</l>
<l>With the seal of his security</l>
<l>For the bloated Wretch on yonder throne</l>
<l>Commanded the bloody fray to rise</l>
<l>Like me he joyed at the stifled moan</l>
<l>Wrung from a Nations miseries</l>
<l>Whilst the snakes whose slime <hi rend="underline">even him</hi> defiled</l>
<l>In extasies of malice smiled . . . .</l>
<l>They thought twas theirs!!—but mine the deed</l>
<l>Theirs is the toil, but mine the meed</l>

<l>Brother well.—the world is ours</l>
<l>And whether thou or I have won</l>
<l>The pestilence expectant lowers</l>
<l>On all beneath yon blasted Sun.</l>
<l>Our joys our toils our honors meet</l>
<l>In the milkwhite &#38; wormy winding sheet</l>
<l>A short lived joy, unceasing care</l>
<l>Some heartless scraps of godly prayer</l>
<l>A moody curse &#38; a frenzied sleep</l>
<l>Ere gapes the graves unclosing deep</l>

<head>To the Emperors of Russia &#38; Austria<lb/>
who eyed the battle of austrtrelitz from<lb/>
the heights whilst Buonaparte was<lb/>
 active in the thickest of the fight<lb/></head>
<lg>
<l>Coward Chiefs! who while the fight</l>
<l>Rages in the plain below</l>
<l>Hide the shame of your affright</l>
<l>On yon distant mountains brow</l>
<l>Does one human feeling creep</l>             
<l>Thro your hearts’ remorseless sleep</l>
<l>On that silence cold &#38; deep</l>
<l>Does one impulse flow</l>
<l>Such as fires the Patriots breast</l>
<l>Such as breaks the Heros rest.</l>
</lg>  
<lg>
<l>No, cowards! ye are calm &#38; still</l>
<l>Keen frosts that blight the human bud</l>
<l>Each opening petal blight &#38; kill</l>
<l>And bathe its tenderness in blood</l>
<l>Ye hear the groans of those who die</l>      
<l>Ye hear the whilstling death shots fly</l>
<l>And when the yells of Victory</l>
<l>Float oer the murdered good</l>
<l>Ye smile secure.—on yonder plain</l>
<l>The game if lost begins again</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>Think ye the restless fiend who haunts</l>
<l>The tumult of yon gory field</l>
<l>Whom neither shame nor danger daunts</l>
<l>Who dares not fear, who cannot yield</l>
<l>Will not with Equalizing blow</l>
<l>Exalt the high, abase the low</l>
<l>And in one mighty shock oerthrow</l>
<l>The slaves that sceptres wield</l> 
<l>Till from the ruin of the storm</l>
<l>Ariseth Freedoms awful form</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>Hushed below the battles jar</l>
<l>Night rests silent on the Heath</l>
<l>Silent save where vultures soar</l>
<l>Above the wounded warriors death</l>
<l>How sleep ye now unfeeling Kings!</l>
<l>Peace seldom folds her snowy wings</l>
<l>On poisoned memorys conscience-stings</l>
<l>Which lurk bad hearts beneath:</l>
<l>Nor downy beds procure repose</l>
<l>Where crime &#38; terror mingle throes</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>Yet may your terrors rest secure</l>
<l>Thou Northern chief why startest thou</l>
<l>Pale Austria calm those fears. be sure</l>
<l>The tyrant needs such slaves as you.</l>
<l>Think ye the world would bear his sway</l>
<l>Were dastards such as you away?</l>
<l>No! they would pluck his plumage gay</l>
<l>Torn from a nations woe</l> 
<l>And lay him in the oblivious gloom</l>

<l>No care or horror bringest thou</l>
<l>To one who draws his breath</l>
<l>Where Zephyrs play &#38; sunbeams shine</l> 
<l>Unstained by any fog of thine</l>

<lg>
<l>Whilst thou obscurest the face of day</l>

<l>Thy malice still my soul shall mar</l>

<l>In that strange mental wandering when to live</l>

<l>The gleaming sky &#38; the fresh seasons birth,</l>
<l>Sensation all it wondrous rapture brings</l>
<l>And to itself not once the mind recurs</l>
<l>Is it foretaste of Heaven?</l>                      
<l>So sweet as this the nerves it stirs</l>
<l>And mingling in the vital tide</l>
<l>With gentle motion driven</l>
<l>Cheers the sunk spirits, lifts the languid eye</l>
<l>And scattering thro the frame its influence wide</l>   
<l>Revives the spirits when they droop &#38; die</l>
<l>The frozen blood with genial beaming warms</l>

<head>On leaving London for Wales.</head>
  <lg>
<l>Thou miserable city! where the gloom</l>
<l>Of penury mingles with the tyrant’s pride,</l>
<l>And virtue bends in sorrow o’er the tomb</l>
<l>Where Freedom’s hope &#38; Truths high Courage died</l>
<l>May floods &#38; vales &#38; mountains me divide</l>    
<l>From all the taints thy wretched walls contain</l> 
<l>That lifes extremes in desolation wide</l>
<l>No more heap horrors on my beating brain</l> 
<l>Nor sting my shuddering heart to sympathy with pain</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>With joy I breathe the last &#38; full farewell</l>
<l>That long has quivered on my burdened heart</l>
<l>My natural sympathies to rapture swell</l>
<l>As from its day thy cheerless glooms depart</l>
<l>Nor all the glare thy gayest scenes impart</l>
<l>Could lure one sigh, could steal one tear from me</l> 
<l>Or lull to languishment the wakeful smart</l>
<l>Which virtue feels for all tis forced to see</l>
<l>Or quench the eternal flame of generous Liberty</l>

<l>Hail to thee Cambria for the unfettered wind</l>
<l>Which from thy wilds even now methinks I feel</l>   
<l>Chasing the clouds that roll in wrath behind</l>
<l>And tightening the souls laxest nerves to steel</l>
<l>True! Mountain Liberty alone may heal</l>
<l>The pain which Customs obduracies bring</l>
<l>And he who dares in fancy even to steal</l>
<l>One draught from Snowdons ever sacred spring</l>
<l>Blots out the unholiest rede of worldly witnessing</l>
    </lg>
<lg>
<l>And shall that soul to selfish peace resigned</l>
<l>So soon forget the woe its fellows share?</l>
<l>Can Snowdons Lethe from the freeborn mind</l>
<l>So soon the page of injured penury tear?</l>
<l>Does this fine mass of human passion dare</l>
<l>To sleep unhonouring the patriots fall</l>
<l>Or lifes sweet load in quietude to bear</l>
<l>While millions famish even in Luxurys hall</l>
<l>And Tyranny high raised stern lowers over all</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>No Cambria! never may thy matchless vales</l>
<l>A heart so false to hope &#38; virtue shield</l>
<l>Nor ever may thy spirit breathing gales</l>
<l>Waft freshness to the slaves who dare to yield.</l>
<l>For me! . . . the weapon that I burn to wield</l>
<l>I seek amid thy rocks to ruin hurled</l>
<l>That Reasons flag may over Freedoms field</l>
<l>Symbol of bloodless victory wave unfurled</l>
<l>A meteor-sign of love effulgent oer the world.</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>Hark to that shriek! my hand had almost clasped</l>
<l>The dagger that my heart had cast away</l>
<l>When the pert slaves whose wanton power had grasped</l>
<l>All hope that springs beneath the eye of day</l>
<l>Pass before Memorys gaze in long array.</l>
<l>The storm fleets by &#38; calmer thoughts succeed</l>
<l>Feelings once more mild reasons voice obey.</l>
<l>Woe be the tyrants &#38; the murderer’s meed</l>
<l>But Natures wound alone sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make their Conscience bleed</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>Do thou wild Cambria calm each struggling thought</l>
<l>Cast thy sweet veil of rocks &#38; woods between</l>
<l>That by the soul to indignation wrought</l>
<l>Mountains &#38; dells be mingled with the scene</l>
<l>Let me forever be what I have been</l>
<l>But not forever at my needy door</l>
<l>Let Misery linger, speechless pale &#38; lean</l>
<l>I am the friend of the unfriended poor</l>
<l>Let me not madly stain their righteous cause in gore</l>
  </lg>
<lg>
<l>No more! the visions fade before my sight</l>
<l>Which Fancy pictures in the waste of air</l>
<l>Like lovely dreams ere mornings chilling light:</l>
<l>And sad realities alone are there</l>
<l>Ah! neither woe nor fear, nor pain can tear</l>
<l>Thier image from the tablet of my soul</l>
<l>Nor the mad floods of despotism where</l>
<l>Lashed into desperate furiousness they roll</l>
<l>Nor passions soothing voice, nor interests cold control</l>

<head>A winters day</head>
<lg>
<l>O! wintry day! that mockest spring</l>
<l>With hopes of the revi<add place="supralinear">vi</add>ng year</l>
<l>That sheddest softness from thy wing</l>
<l>And near the cascades murmuring</l>
<l>Awakenest sounds so clear</l>

  </lg>

<l>Why hast thou given O year! to May</l>
<l>A birth so premature</l>
<l>To live one incompleted day</l>
<l>That the mad whirlwinds sullen sway</l>
<l>May sweep it from the moor</l>
<l>And winter reassume the sway</l>
<l>That shall so long endure</l>

<l>Art thou like Genius’s matin bloom</l>
<l>Unwelcome promise of its prime</l>
<l>That scattereth its rich perfume</l>
<l>Around the portals of the tomb</l>
<l>Decking the scar of time</l>
<l>In mockery of the early doom</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Art thou like Passions rapturous dream</l>
<l>That o’er lifes stormy dawn</l>
<l>Doth dart its wild &#38; flamy beam</l>
<l>Yet like a fleeting flash doth seem</l>
<l>When many chequered years are gone</l>
<l>And tell the illusion of its gleam</l>
<l>Lifes blasted springs alone</l>
    </lg>
<lg>
<l>Whate’er thou emblemest I’ll breathe</l>
<l>Thy transitory sweetness now</l>
<l>And whether Health with roseate wreathe</l>
<l>May bind mine head, or creeping Death</l>
<l>Steal oer my pulses flow,</l>
<l>Struggling the wintry winds beneath</l>
<l>I’ll love thy vernal glow</l>

<head>A Tale of Society as it is<lb/> 
 from facts  1811</head>  
<lg>
<l>She was an Aged Woman, &#38; the years</l>
<l>Which she had numbered on her toilsome way</l>
<l>Had bowed her natural powers to decay</l>
<l>She was an Aged Woman yet the ray</l>
<l>Which faintly glimmered thro the starting tears</l>
<l>Pressed from their beds by silent misery</l>
<l>Hath souls imperishable energy</l>
<l>She was a cripple, &#38; incapable</l>
<l>To add one mite to golden luxury</l>
<l>And therefore did her spirit clearly feel</l>
<l>That Poverty the crime of tainting stain</l>
<l>Would merge her in its depths never to rise again</l> 
</lg>
    <lg>
<l>One only sons love had supported her.</l>
<l>She long had struggled with infirmity</l>
<l>Lingering from human lifescenes, for to die</l>
<l>When fate has spared to rend some mental tie</l>
<l>Not many wish, &#38; surely fewer dare.</l>
<l>But when the tyrants bloodhounds forced her Child</l>
<l>For tyrants power unhallowed arms to wield</l>
<l>Bend to anothers will. become a thing</l>
<l>More senseless than the sword of battle field</l>
<l>Then did she feel keen sorrows keenest sting</l>
<l>And many years had past ere comfort they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> bring</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>For seven years did this poor woman live</l>
<l>In unparticipated solitude</l>
<l>Thou mightst have seen her in the desart rude</l>
<l>Picking the scattered remnants of its wood</l>
<l>If human thou mightst then have learned to grieve</l>
<l>The gleanings of precarious charity</l>
<l>Her scantiness of food did scarce supply</l>         
<l>The proofs of an unspeaking sorrow dwelt</l>
<l>Within her ghastly hollowness of eye:</l>
<l>Each arrow of the Seasons change she felt</l>
<l>Yet still she yearned ere her sad course were run</l> 
<l>One only hope it was, once more to see her son</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>It was an eve of June, when every star</l>
<l>Spoke peace from Heaven to those on Earth that live</l>
<l>She rested on the moor . . . . ’twas such an eve</l> 
<l>When first her soul began indeed to grieve</l>
<l>Then he was here . . . now he is very far</l>         
<l>The freshness of the balmy evening</l>
<l>A sorrow oer her weary soul did fling</l>
<l>Yet not devoid of raptures mingled tear;</l>
<l>A balm was in the poison of the sting:</l>
<l>This aged sufferer for many a year,</l>                   
<l>Had never felt such comfort . . . . she supprest</l>
<l>A sigh, &#38; turning round claspd William to her breast</l>
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>And tho his form was wasted by the woe</l>
<l>Which despots on their victims love to wreak</l>
<l>Tho his sunk eyeball, &#38; his faded cheek</l>        
<l>Of slavery violence &#38; scorn did speak</l>
<l>Yet did the aged Womans bosom glow</l>
<l>The vital fire seemed reillumed within</l>
<l>By this sweet unexpected welcoming.</l>
<l>O! consummation of the fondest hope</l>                  
<l>That ever soared on Fancys dauntless wing</l>
<l>O! tenderness that foundst so sweet a scope!</l>
<l>Prince! who dost swell upon thy mighty sway.</l>
<l>When thou canst feel such love thou shalt be great as they</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>Her son, compelled the tyrants foes had fought</l>
<l>Had bled in battle, &#38; the stern control</l>
<l>That ruled his sinews &#38; coerced his soul</l>
<l>Utterly poisoned lifes unmingled bowl</l>
<l>And unsubduable evils on him wrought</l>
<l>He was the shadow of the lusty child</l> 
<l>Who when the time of summer season smiled</l>
<l>For her did earn a meal of honesty</l>
<l>And with affectionate discourse beguiled</l>
<l>The keen attacks of pain &#38; poverty</l>
<l>Till power as envying this her only joy</l>         
<l>From her maternal bosom tore the unhappy boy</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>And now cold charitys unwelcome dole</l>
<l>Was insufficient to support the pair</l>
<l>And they would perish rather than would bear</l>
<l>The laws stern slavery &#38; the insolent stare</l> 
<l>With which law loves to rend the poor man’s soul</l>
<l>The bitter scorn, the spirit sinking noise</l>
<l>Of heartless mirth which women men &#38; boys</l>
<l>Wake in this scene of legal misery . . .</l>
<l>Oh! Williams spirit rather would rejoice</l>
<l>On some wild heath with his dear charge to die</l>
<l>The death that keenest penury might give</l>
<l>Were sweeter far than cramped by slavery to live</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>And they have born thus long the winters cold</l>
<l>The driving sleet the penetrating rain</l>      
<l>It seemeth that their element is pain</l>
<l>And that they never will feel life again</l>
<l>For is it life to be so deathlike old?—</l>
<l>The suns kind light feeds every living thing</l>
<l>That spreads its blossoms to the breath of spring</l>    
<l>But who feeds thee unhappy wanderer?</l>
<l>With the fat slaves who
  <subst>
    <add place="supralinear">from</add>
    <del rend="overstrike">by</del></subst> the rich mans board</l>
<l>Lick the fallen crumbs thou scantily dost share</l>
<l>And mutterest for the gift a heartless prayer</l>
<l>The flow’rs fade not thus. thou must poorly die</l>
<l>The changeful year feeds them. the tyrant man feeds thee</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>And is it life that in youths blasted morn</l>
<l>Not one of youths dear raptures are enjoyed</l> 
<l>All natural bliss with servitude alloyed</l>
<l>The beating heart the sparkling eye destroyd</l>  
<l>And manhood of its brightest glories shorn</l> 
<l>Debased by rapine drunkenness &#38; woe,</l>
<l>The foemans sword the vulgar tyrant’s blow</l>
<l>Ruined in body &#38; soul till Heaven arrive</l>
<l>His health &#38; peace insultingly laid low</l>           
<l>Without a fear to die or wish to live</l>
<l>Withered &#38; sapless, miserably poor,</l>
<l>Relinquished for his wounds to beg from door to door</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>Seest thou yon humble sod where oziers bind</l>
<l>The pillow of the monumentless dead.</l>
<l>There since her thorny pilgrimage is sped</l>
<l>The aged ufferer rests on the cold bed</l>
<l>Which all who seek or who avoid must find</l>
<l>O let her sleep! &#38; there at close of eve</l>
<l>Twere holiness in solitude to grieve</l>               
<l>And ponder on the wretchedness of Earth</l>
<l>With joy of melancholy I would leave</l>
<l>A spot that to such deep-felt thoughts gives birth</l>
<l>And tho I could not pour the useless prayer</l>
<l>Would weep upon the grave &#38; leave a blessing there</l>

<l>It is not blasphemy to hope that Heaven</l>

<l>Which throb within the pulses of the blood</l>
<l>And sweeten all that bitterness which Earth</l>

<l>Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path</l>
<l>Which this lone spirit travelled, drear &#38; cold</l>
<l>Yet swiftly leading to those awful limits</l>
<l>Which mark the bounds of Time &#38; of the space</l>
<l>When Time shall be no more: wilt thou not turn</l>
<l>Those spirit beaming eyes and look on me,</l>
<l>Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven</l>
<l>And Heaven is Earth?—will not thy glowing cheek</l>
<l>Glowing with soft suffusion, rest on mine</l>
<l>And breathe magnetic sweetness thro the frame</l>
<l>Of my corporeal nature, thro’ the soul</l>
<l>Now knit with these fine fibres. I would give</l>
<l>The longest &#38; the happiest day that fate</l>
<l>Has marked on my existence, but to feel</l>
<l><hi rend="underline">One</hi> soul reviving kiss . . . oh thou most dear</l>
<l>Tis an assurance that this Earth is Heaven</l>
<l>And Heaven the flower of that untainted seed</l>
<l>Which springeth here beneath such love as ours.</l>
<l>Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve</l>
<l>But ours shall not be mortal—the cold hand</l>
<l>Of Time may chill the love of Earthly minds</l>    
<l>Half frozen now, the frigid intercourse</l>
<l>Of common souls, lives but a summers day</l>
<l>It dies where it arose upon this Earth</l>
<l>But ours! oh tis the stretch of fancy’s hope</l>
<l>To portray its continuance as now</l>
<l>Warm, tranquil, spirit healing.  Nor when age</l>
<l>Has tempered these wild extacies, &#38; given</l>

<l>Makes virtuous passion supercede the power</l>
<l>Of reason, nor when life’s æstival sun</l>
<l>To deeper manhood shall have ripened me.</l>
<l>Nor when some years have added judgements store</l>
<l>To all thy woman sweetness, all the fire</l>

<l>Shall custom so corrupt, or the cold forms</l>
<l>Of this desolate world so harden us</l>
<l>As when we think of the dear love that binds</l>
<l>Our souls in soft communion, while we know</l>
<l>Each others thoughts &#38; feelings, can we say</l>
<l>Unblushingly a heartless compliment</l>
<l>Praise, hate or love with the unthinking world</l>
<l>Or dare to cut the unrelaxing nerve</l>
<l>That knits our love to Virtue—can those eyes</l>
<l>Beaming with mildest radiance on my heart</l>
<l>To purify its purity e’er bend</l>
<l>To soothe its vice or consecrate its fears?</l>
<l>Never thou second self! is confidence</l>
<l>So vain in virtue that I learn to doubt</l>
<l>The mirror even of Truth?—Dark Flood of Time</l>
<l>Roll as it listeth thee. I measure not</l>
<l>By months or moments thy ambiguous course</l>
<l>Another may stand by me on thy brink</l>
<l>And watch the bubble whirled beyond his ken</l>

<l>My life more actual living will contain</l>

<l>A more heaven breathing fragrance &#38; sense enchanting bloom</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>And then on Summer evens I will hasten to inhale</l>
<l>Remembering that thou wert so kind thy balmy balmy breath</l>                
<l>And when thy tender pinions in the gloom begin to fail</l>
<l>I will catch thee to my bosom ere thou diest on the heath</l> 
    </lg>
    <lg>
<l>I will catch thee to my bosom—&#38; if Henry’s oaths are true</l>
<l>A softer sweeter grave thou wilt never find than there</l>
<l>Nor is it lovely sea wind, nor is it to undo</l>
<l>That my arms are so inviting that my bosom is so fair</l>

<l>The mansions of the Kings are tenantless . . . .</l>
<l>Low lie in dust their glory &#38; their shame</l>
<l>No tongue survives their virtuous deeds to bless</l>
<l>No tongue with execration blasts their fame</l>
<l>But on some ruined pile, where yet the gold<hi rend="superscript">1</hi><anchor id="a001" corresp="n001"></anchor></l>
<l>Casts purple brilliance oer colossal snow</l>
<l>Where sapphire eyes in breathing statues glow</l>
<l>And the tainted blast sighs mid the reeds below</l>
<l>Where grim effigies of the Gods of old</l>
<l>In mockery stand of ever changing men</l>
<l>Thier ever changing worship. ah how vain!</l>
<l>(Yet baubles aye must please the multitude)</l>
<l>There Desolation dwells!—Where are the Kings</l>

Devonshire—August 1812</head>
<lg>
<l>Quenched is old Oceans rage</l>
<l>Each horrent wave that flung</l>
<l>Its neck that writhed beneath the tempests scourge</l>
<l>Indignant up to Heaven</l>
<l>Now breathes in its sweet slumber</l>              
<l>To mingle with the day</l>
<l>A spirit of tranquillity</l>
<l>Beneath the cloudless sun</l>
<l>The gently swelling main</l>
<l>Scatters a thousand colourings</l>
  <note>the present day---<lb/></note>
<l>And the wind that wanders vaguely thro the void</l>
<l>With the flapping of the Sail, &#38; the dashing at the prow</l>
<l>And the whistle of the sailor in that shadow of a calm</l>
<l>A ravishing harmony makes.</l>
<l>O! why is a rapt soul e’er recalled</l>
<l>From the palaces of visioned bliss</l>
<l>To the cells of real sorrow!</l>
</lg>
      <lg>
<l>That little vessels company</l>
<l>Beheld the sight of loveliness</l>
<l>The dark grey rocks that towered</l>                 
<l>Above the slumbering sea,</l>
<l>And their reflected forms</l>
<l>Deep in its faintly-waving mirror given</l>      
<l>They heard the low breeze sighing</l>
<l>The listless sails and ropes among</l>  
<l>They heard the music at the prow,</l>
<l>And the hoarse, distant clash</l>
<l>Sent from yon gloomy caves</l>
<l>Where Earth &#38; Ocean strive for mastery</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>A mingled mass of feeling</l>
<l>Those human spirits prest</l>
<l>As they heard, &#38; saw, &#38; felt</l>
<l>Some fancied fear, &#38; some real woe</l>
<l>Mixed with those glimpses of heavenly joy</l>
<l>That dawned on each passive soul</l>
<l>Where is the woe that never sees</l>
<l>One joybeam illumine the night of the mind</l>
<l>Where is the bliss that never feels</l>
<l>One dart from the quiver of earthly pain</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>The young &#38; happy spirits now</l>
<l>Along the world are voyaging</l>
<l>Love, friendship virtue truth</l>
<l>Simplicity of sentiment &#38; speech</l>
<l>And other sensibilities</l>
<l>Known by no outward name</l>
<l>Some faults that Love forgives</l>
<l>Some flaws that Friendship shares</l>
<l>Hearts passionate &#38; benevolent</l>
<l>Alive, &#38; urgent to repair</l>
<l>The errors of their brother heads;</l>
<l>All voyage with them too.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>They look to land . . . . they look to Sea</l>
<l>Bounded one is, &#38; palpable</l>
<l>Even as a noonday scene . .</l>
<l>The other indistinct &#38; dim</l>
<l>Spangled with dizzying sunbeams</l>
<l>Boundless, untrod by human step</l>
<l>Like the vague blisses of a midnight dream</l>
<l>Or Deaths immeasurable main</l>
<l>Whose lovely islands gleam at intervals</l>
<l>Upon the Spirits visioned solitude</l>
<l>Thro' Earths wide woven and many colourd veil</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>It is a moveless calm.</l>
<l>The sailors whistle shrill</l>
<l>Speeds clearly thro the sleeping atmosphere</l>
<l>As country curates pray for rain</l>
<l>When drought has frustrated full long</l>
<l>He whistles for a wind</l>
<l>With just the same success</l>
<l>Two honest souls were they</l>
<l>And oft had braved in fellowship the storm</l>
<l>Till from that fellowship had sprung</l>
<l>A sense of right &#38; liberty</l>
<l>Unbending undismayed, aye they had seen</l>
<l>Where danger death &#38; terror played</l>
<l>With human lives in the boiling deep,</l>
<l>And they had seen the scattered spray</l>
<l>Of the green &#38; jagged mountain-wave</l>
<l>Hid in the lurid tempest cloud</l>
<l>With lightnings tinging all its fleeting form</l>
<l>Rolled oer their fragile bark.</l>
<l>A dread &#38; hopeless month</l>
<l>Had they participated once</l>
<l>In that diminutive bark:—</l>
<l>Thier tearless eyes uplifted unto Heaven</l>
<l>So fruitlessly for aid!</l>
<l>Thier parched mouths oped eager to the shower</l>
<l>So thin &#38; sleety in that arctic clime</l>
<l>Their last hard crust was shared</l>
<l>Impartial in equality</l>
<l>And in the dreadful night</l>
<l>When all had failed . . . even hope</l>
<l>Together they had shared the gleam</l>
<l>Shot from yon lighthouse tower</l>
<l>Across the waste of waves.</l>
<l>And therefore are they brave, free, generous</l>
<l>For who that had so long fought hand to hand</l>
<l>With famine, toil &#38; hazard. smild at Death</l>
<l>When leaning from the bursting billows height</l>
<l>He stares so ghastly terrible, would waste</l>
<l>One needless word for lifes contested toys?</l>
<l>Who that had shared his last and nauseous crust</l>
<l>With Famine &#38; a friend, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not divide</l>
<l>A landsmans meal with one who needed it</l>
<l>Who that could rule the elements &#38; spurn</l>
<l>Their fiercest rage, would bow before a slave</l>
<l>Decked in the fleetingness of Earthly power</l>
<l>Who that had seen the soul of Nature work</l>
<l>Blind, changeless &#38; eternal in her paths</l>  
<l>Would shut his eyes &#38; ears, quaking before</l>
        <note>
          It is remarkable that few are more<lb/>
          experimentally convinced of the doc<lb/>

<l>A landsman there reclined</l>
<l>With lowering close contracted brow</l>               
<l>And mouth updrawn at intervals</l>
<l>As fearful of his fluctuating bent</l>
<l>His eyes wide-wandering round</l>
<l>In insecure malignity</l>
<l>Rapacious, mean, cruel &#38; cowardly</l>                
<l>Casting upon the loveliness of day</l>
<l>The murkiness of villainy . . .</l>
<l>By other nurses than the battling storm</l>

<l>His manhood had been cradled</l>                
<l>Inheritor to all the vice &#38; fear</l>
<l>Which Kings &#38; laws &#38; priests &#38; conquerors spread</l>
        <note>
          generosity of sefaring men probably is<lb/>
          an effect of this cause. Those employed<lb/>
          in small &#38; ill equipped trading vessels<lb/>
        </note>
<l>On the woe-fertilized world.</l>
<l>Yes! in the dawn of life</l>
<l>When guileless confidence and unthinking love</l>       
<l>Dilate all hearts but those</l>
<l>Which servitude or power has cased in steel</l>
<l>He bound himself to an unhappy woman</l>
<l>Not of those pure &#38; heavenly links that Love</l>
<l>Twines round a feeling to Freedom dear</l>        
<l>But of vile gold, cankring the breast it binds</l>
<l>Corroding &#38; inflaming every thought</l>
<l>Till vain desire, remorse &#38; fear</l>
<l>Envenom all the being</l>

<l>Not bind the grosser body, he was wont</l>
<l>All means to try of thriving</l>
        <note>
          seem to posess this generosity in a purer<lb/>
          degree than those of a King's ship. The<lb/>
          habits of subjection &#38; coercion imbued<lb/>
          into the latter may suffice to explain<lb/>
          the cause of the difference.<lb/>
        </note>
<l>To those above him, the most servile cringe</l>
<l>That ignorance e’er gave to titled Vice</l>
<l>Was simperingly yielded</l>                  
<l>To those beneath, the frown which Commerce darts</l>
<l>On cast off friends, unprofitably poor</l>
<l>Was less severe than his</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>There was another too . . .</l>
<l>One of another mould</l>
<l>He had been cradled in the wildest storm</l>
<l>Of Passion, &#38; tho’ now</l>
<l>The feebler light of worn-out energies</l>
<l>Shone on his soul, yet ever and anon</l>
<l>A flash of tempests long past by</l>
<l>Would wake to pristine visions</l>
<l>Now he was wrapt in a wild woeful dream</l>
<l>Deeply his soul could love</l>
<l>And as he gazed on the boundless sea</l>
<l>Chequered with sunbeams &#38; with shade</l>
<l>Alternate to infinity</l>
<l>He fell into a dream</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>He dreamed that all he loved</l>
<l>Across the shoreless wastes were voyaging</l>
<l>By that unpitying landsman piloted</l>
<l>And that at length they came</l>
<l>To a black &#38; barren island rock</l>
<l>Barren the isle . . . no egg</l>
<l>Which sea mews leave upon the wildest shore</l>
<l>Barren the isle . . no blade</l>
<l>Of grass, no seaweed, not the vilest thing</l>
<l>For human nutriment . . . .</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l><del rend="overstrike">He</del></l>
<l>He struggled with the pitiless landsman then</l>
<l>But nerved tho his frame with love,</l>
<l>Quenchless, despairing love,</l>
<l>It nought availed . . . strong Power</l>
<l>Truth, love &#38; courage vanquished</l>
<l>A rock was piled upon his feeble breast</l>
<l>All was subdued, but that</l>
<l>Which is immortal, unsubduable</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>He still continued dreaming . . . .</l> 
<l>The rock upon his bosom quenched not</l>
<l>The frenzy &#38; defiance of his eye</l>
<l>But the strong &#38; coward landsman laughed to scorn</l>
<l>His unprevailing fortitude</l>   
<l>And in security of malice stabbed</l>
<l>One who accompanied his voyagings</l>
<l>The blood gushed forth. the eye grew dim</l>
<l>The nerve relaxed, the life was gone</l>
<l>His smile of dastardly revenge</l>
<l>Glared upon dead frame</l>
<l>Then back the Victim flung his head</l>
<l>In horror insupportable</l>
<l>Upon the jagged rock whereon he lay</l>
<l>And human Nature paused awhile</l>
<l>In pity to his woe.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>When he awaked to life</l>
<l>She whom he loved was bending over him</l>
<l>Haggard her sunken eye . . . .</l>
<l>Bloodless her quivering lips . . .</l>
<l>She bended to bestow</l>
<l>The burning moisture from her feverish tongue</l>
<l>To lengthen out his life</l>
<l>Perhaps till succour came! . .</l>
<l>But more her dear soft eyes in languid love</l>
<l>When lifes last gleam was flickering in decay</l>
<l>The waning spark rekindled</l>
<l>And the faint lingering kiss of her withered lips</l>
<l>Mingled a rapture with his misery</l>
<l>A bleeding Sister lay</l>
<l>Beside this wretched pair</l>
<l>And He the dastard of relentless soul</l>
<l>In moody malice lowered over all.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>And this is but a dream!</l>
<l>For yonder—see! the port in sight</l>
<l>The vessel makes towards it!</l>
<l>The sight of their safety then,</l>
<l>And the hum of the populous town</l>
<l>Awakened them from a night of horror</l>
<l>To a day of secure delight</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Lo! here a populous Town</l>
<l>Two dark rocks either side defend</l>
<l>The quiet water sleeps within</l>
<l>Reflecting every roof &#38; every mast</l>
<l>A populous town! it is a den</l>
<l>Where wolves keep lambs to fatten on their blood</l>
<l>Tis a distempered spot. should there be one</l>
<l>Just, dauntless, rational, he would appear</l>
<l>A madman to the rest.</l>

      <lg>
<l>Yes! smooth-faced tyrants chartered by a Power</l>
<l>Called King, who in the castellated keep</l>
<l>Of a far distant land wears out his days</l>
<l>Of miserable dotage, pace the quay</l>
<l>And by the magic of that dreadful word</l>
<l>Hated tho’ dreadful, shield their impotence,</l>
<l>Their lies, their murders, &#38; their robberies</l>
<l>See, where the sailors absent many years</l>
<l>With Heaven in his rapture-speaking eyes</l>
<l>Seeks the low cot where all his wealth reposes</l>
<l>To bring himself for joy, &#38; his small store</l>
<l>Hard earned by years of peril &#38; of toil</l>
<l>For comfort to his famine wasted babes</l>
<l>Deep in the dark blue Sea the unmoving moon</l>
<l>Gleams beautifully quiet . . . such a night</l>
<l>When the last kiss from Marys quivering lips</l>
<l>Unmanned him. to the well known door he speeds</l>
<l>His faint hand pauses on the latch . . His heart</l>
<l>Beats eagerly.—When suddenly the gang</l>
<l>Dissolves his dream of rapture—no delay!</l>
<l>No pity! unexpostulating power</l>
<l>Deals not in human feelings . . . he is stript</l>
<l>By those low slaves whose masters names inflict</l>
<l>Curses more fell than even themselves would give;</l>
<l>The Indian muslins &#38; the Chinese toys</l>
<l>These for small gain, &#38; those for boundless love</l>
<l>Thus carefully concealed are torn away;</l>
<l>The very handkerchief his Mary gave</l>
<l>Which in unchanging faithfulness he wore</l>
<l>Rent from his manly neck! his kindling eye</l>
<l>Beamed vengeance, &#38; the tyrant’s manacles</l>
<l>Shook on his struggling arm; "Where is my Wife?</l>
<l>Where are my Children?"—close beside him stood</l>
<l>A sleek &#38; pampered town’s man—"oh! your wife</l>
<l>"Died this time year in the House of Industry</l>
<l>"Your young ones all are dead, except one brat</l>
<l>"Stubborn as you—Parish apprentice now"</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>They have appropriated human life</l>
<l>And human happiness but these weigh nought</l>

<l>Who finds that murder is expedient</l>
<l>And that vile means can answer glorious ends.</l>
<l>Wide Nature has outstretched her fertile Earth</l>
<l>In commonage to all.—But they have torn</l>
<l>Her dearest offspring from her bleeding breast,</l>
<l>Have disunited Liberty &#38; life</l>
<l>Severed all right from duty, &#38; confused</l>
<l>Virtue with selfishness.—the grass green hills</l>
<l>The fertile vallies and the limpid streams</l>

<l>Where cataracts have roared ere Monarchs were</l>
<l>Nature fair Earth, &#38; Heavens untainted air</l>
<l>Are all apportioned out . . . some bloated Lord</l>
<l>Some priestly pilferer, or some Snake of Law</l>
<l>Some miserable mockery of a man</l>
<l>Some slave without a heart, looks over these</l>
<l>And calls them <hi rend="underline">Mine</hi>—in self-approving pride.</l>
<l>The millionth of the produce of the vale</l>
<l>He sets apart for <hi rend="underline">charity</hi>. Vain fool!</l>
<l>He gives in mercy, while stern Justice cries</l>
<l>Be thou as one of them—resign thine hall</l>
<l>Brilliant with murder’s trophies, &#38; the board</l>
<l>Loaded with surfeiting viands, &#38; the gems</l>

Those employed in small and ill-equipped trading vessels seem to possess this generosity in a purer degree than those of a King’s ship.  The habits of subjection and coercion imbued into the latter may suffice to explain the cause of the difference.

  <head>A Dialogue—1809</head>
<lg>
<head>Death</head>
<l>Yes! my dagger is drenched with the blood of the brave.</l>
<l>I have sped with Love’s wings from the battlefield grave</l>
<l>Where Ambition is hushed neath the peacegiving sod</l>
<l>And slaves cease to tremble at Tyranny’s nod.</l>
<l>I offer a calm habitation to thee,</l>       
<l>Victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?</l>
<l>Drear and damp is my hall, but a mild Judge is there</l>
<l>Who steeps in oblivion the brands of Despair.</l>
<l>Nor a groan of regret, nor a sigh, nor a breath</l>
<l>Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death;</l>  
<l>Nor the howlings of envy resound thro’ the gloom</l>
<l>That shrouds in its mantle the slaves of the tomb.</l>
<l>I offer a calm habitation to thee;</l>
<l>Say, Victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?</l> 
</lg>
      <lg>
<head>Mortal</head>
<l>Mine eyelids are heavy, my soul seeks repose—</l>       
<l>It longs in thy arms to embosom its woes,</l>
<l>It longs in that realm to deposit its load</l>
<l>Where no longer the scorpions of perfidy goad,</l>
<l>Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away</l>
<l>And Bigotry’s bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.</l>   
<l>Yet tell me, dark Death, when thine Empire is o’er</l>
<l>What awaits on futurity’s mist-circled shore?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<head>Death</head>
<l>Cease, cease, wayward mortal! I dare not unveil</l>
<l>The shadows that float oer eternity’s vale.</l>
<l>What thinkest thou will wait thee? A *Spirit of Love</l> 
<l>That will hail thy blest advent to mansions above?</l>
<l>For Love, mortal! gleams thro’ the gloom of my sway</l>
<l>And the clouds that surround me fly fast at its ray.</l>
<l>Hast thou <hi rend="underline">loved</hi>?—then depart from these regions of hate</l>
<l>And in slumber with me quench the arrows of fate</l>  
<l>That canker and burn in the wounds of a heart</l>
<l>That urges its sorrows with me to depart.</l>
<l>I offer a calm habitation to thee;</l>
<l>Say, Victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<head>Mortal</head>
<l>Oh sweet is thy slumber, and sweeter the ray</l>         
<l>Which after thy night introduces the day!</l>
<l>How soft, how persuasive, self-interest’s breath</l>
<l>Tho’ it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!</l>
<l>I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,</l>
<l>Yet a lingering friend may be grieved at my fall,</l>    
<l>And Virtue forbids, tho’ I languish to die,</l>
<l>When Departure might heave Virtue’s breast with a sigh.</l>
<l>Yet Death! oh! my friend, snatch this form to thy shrine</l>
<l>And I fear, dear destroyer, I shall not repine.</l>

*The author begs to be understood by this expression neither to mean the Creator of the Universe, nor the Christian Deity.—When this little poem was written the line stood thus, "What waits for the good?" but he has altered it on transcription, because however his feelings may love to linger on a future state of Happiness, neither Justice, reason nor passion can reconcile to his belief that the crimes of this life, equally necessary and inevitable as its virtues, should be punished in another: 
<l>"Earth in itself</l>
<l>"Contains at once the evil and the cure</l>
<l>"And all sufficing Nature can chastize</l>
<l>"Those who transgress her law."</l></note>

<l>How eloquent are eyes!</l>
<l>Not the rapt Poet’s frenzied lay</l>
<l>When the soul’s wildest feelings stray</l>
<l>Can speak so well as they.</l>
<l>How eloquent are eyes!</l>
<l>Not music’s most impassioned note</l>
<l>On which love’s warmest fervours float</l>
<l>Like they bid rapture rise.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Love! look thus again,</l>
<l>That your look may light a waste of years</l>
<l>Darting the beam that conquers cares</l>
<l>Thro’ the cold shower of tears!</l>
<l>Love! look thus again,</l>
<l>That Time the victor as he flies</l>
<l>May pause to gaze upon thine eyes,</l>
<l>A victor then in vain!—</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Yet no! arrest not Time,</l>
<l>For Time, to others dear, we spurn,</l>
<l>When Time shall <hi rend="underline">be</hi> no more we burn</l>
<l>When Love meets full return.</l>
<l>Ah no! arrest not Time.</l>
<l>Fast let him fly on eagle wing,</l>
<l>Nor pause till Heaven’s unfading spring</l>
<l>Breathes round its holy clime.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Yet quench that thrilling gaze</l>
<l>Which passionate Friendship arms with fire,</l>
<l>For what will eloquent eyes inspire</l>
<l>But feverish, false desire?</l>
<l>Quench then that thrilling gaze</l>
<l>For age may freeze the tremulous joy;</l>
<l>But age can never <hi rend="underline">love</hi> destroy.</l>
<l>It lives to better days.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Age cannot love destroy.</l>
<l>Can perfidy then blight its flower</l>
<l>Even when in most unwary hour</l>
<l>It blooms in fancy’s bower?</l>
<l>Age cannot love destroy.</l>
<l>Can slighted vows then rend the shrine</l>
<l>On which its chastened splendours shine</l>
<l>Around a dream of joy?</l>
</lg>

<head>1810</head>
<lg>
<l>Hopes that bud in youthful breasts</l>
<l>Live not thro’ the lapse of time:</l>
<l>Love’s rose a host of thorns invest</l>
<l>And ungenial is the clime</l>
<l>Where its blossoms blow.</l>
<l>Youth says—the purple flowers are mine</l>
<l>That fade the while they glow.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Dear the boon to Fancy given,</l>
<l>Retracted while ’tis granted.</l>
<l>Sweet the rose that breathes in Heaven</l>
<l>Altho’ on Earth ’tis planted,</l>
<l>Where its blossoms blow,</l>
<l>Where by the frosts its leaves are riven</l>
<l>That fade the while they glow.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>The pure soul lives that heart within</l>
<l>Which age cannot remove</l>
<l>If undefiled by tainting sin,</l>
<l>A sanctuary of love</l>
<l>Where its blossoms blow,</l>
<l>Where, in this unsullied shrine,</l>
<l>They fade not while they glow.</l>

<head>September 23, 1809</head> 
<lg>
<l>Moonbeam! leave the shadowy dale</l>
<l>To cool this burning brow—</l>
<l>Moonbeam, why art thou so pale</l>
<l>As thou glidest along the midnight vale</l>
<l>Where dewy flowrets grow?</l>
<l>Is it to mimic me?</l>
<l>Ah, that can never be;</l>
<l>For thy path is bright</l>
<l>And the clouds are light</l>
<l>That at intervals shadow the star-studded night.</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Now all is deathy still on Earth,</l>
<l>Nature’s tired frame reposes;</l>
<l>Yet ere the golden morning’s birth</l>
<l>Its radiant gates uncloses,</l>
<l>Flies forth her balmy breath;</l>
<l>But mine is the midnight of death,</l>
<l>And Nature’s morn</l>
<l>To my bosom forlorn</l>
<l>Brings but a gloomier night, implants a deadlier thorn.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Wretch! suppress the glare of madness</l>
<l>Struggling in thine haggard eye,</l>
<l>For the keenest throb of sadness,</l>
<l>Pale despair’s most sickening sigh,</l>
<l>Is but to mimic me.</l>
<l>But that can never be</l>               
<l>When the darkness of care</l>
<l>And the death of despair</l>
<l>Seem in my breast but joys to the pangs that rankle there.</l>
  </lg>
  </lg>

 
<lg>
<head>To Mary I</head>
<lg>
<l>Dear girl! thou art wildered by madness,</l>
<l>Yet do not look so, sweet.</l>
<l>I could share in the sigh of thy sadness,</l>
<l>Thy woe my soul could meet.</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>I loved a heart sincerely.</l>
<l>Yes! dear it was to mine;</l>
<l>Yet, Mary, I love more dearly</l>
<l>One tender look of thine.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Oh! do not say that Heaven</l>
<l>Will frown on errors past;</l>
<l>Thy faults are all forgiven,</l>
<l>Thy Virtues ever last.*</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>The cup with death o’erflowing</l>
<l>I’ll drink, fair girl, to thee.</l>
<l>For when the storm is blowing</l>
<l>To shelter we may flee.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Thou canst not bear to languish</l>
<l>In this frail chain of clay,</l>
<l>And I am tired of anguish.</l>
<l>Love! let us haste away!</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Like thee, I fear to weather</l>
<l>Death’s darksome wave alone.</l>
<l>We’ll take the voyage together.</l>
<l>Come, Mary! let’s begone.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Strange mists my woe efface, love,</l>
<l>And thou art pale in Death . . . .</l>
<l>Give one, one last embrace, love,</l>
<l>And we resign our breath.</l> 
</lg>

*This opinion is of all others the most deeply rooted in my conviction.  The enquirer will laugh at it as a dream, the Christian will abhor it as blasphemy.—Mary, who repeatedly attempted suicide, yet was unwilling to die alone.—Nor is it probable that she would, had I instead of my friend been subjected to the trial of sitting a summer’s night by her side.—whilst two glasses of poison stood on the table, and she folded me to her tremulous bosom in extasies of friendship and despair!— What are the Romances of Leadenhall Str. to this of real life?

<lg>
   <head>To Mary II</head>
<lg>
<l>Fair one! calm that bursting heart . . . .</l>
<l>Dares then fate to frown on thee,</l>
<l>Lovely, spotless as thou art?</l>
<l>Tho’ its worst poison lights on me,</l>
<l>Then dry that tear;</l>
<l>Thou needest not fear</l>
<l>These woes when thy limbs are cold on the bier.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Start not from winter’s breathing, dearest,</l>
<l>Tho’ bleak is yonder hill . . .</l>
<l>As perjured love the blast thou fearest</l>
<l>Is not half so deadly chill;</l>
<l>Like these winds that blow</l>
<l>No remorse does it know</l>
<l>And colder it strikes than the driving snow.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>The tomb is damp and dark and low,</l>
<l>Yet with thee the tomb I do not dread.</l>
<l>There is not a place of frightful woe</l>
<l>Where with thee I’d refuse to lay my head . . .</l>
<l>But our souls shall not sleep</l>
<l>In the grave damp and deep</l>
<l>But in love and devotion their holy day keep.*</l>

<lg>
<head>To Mary III</head>
<lg>
<l>Mary, Mary! art thou gone</l>
<l>To sleep in thine earthy cell?</l>
<l>Presses thy breast the death-cold stone?</l>
<l>Pours none the tear, the sob, the groan,</l>
<l>Where murdered virtue sleeps alone</l>
<l>Where its first glory fell?</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Mary, Mary, past is past!</l>
<l>I submit in silence to fate’s decree,</l>
<l>Tho’ the tear of distraction gushes fast</l>
<l>And at night when the lank reeds hiss in the blast</l>
<l>My spirit mourns in sympathy.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Thou wert more fair in mind than are</l>
<l>The fabled heavenly train,</l>
<l>But thine was the pang of corroding care,</l>
<l>Thine, cold contempt and lone despair</l>
<l>And thwarted love—more hard to bear . . .</l>
<l>And I—wretch!—weep that such they were,</l>
<l>And I . . . . still drag my chain.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Thou wert but born to weep, to die,</l>
<l>To feel dissolved the dearest tie—</l>
<l>Its fragments by the pityless world</l>
<l>Adown the blast of fortune hurl’d</l>
<l>To strive with envy’s wreckful storm.</l>
<l>Thou wert but born to weep and die,</l>
<l>Nor could thy ceaseless misery,</l>
<l>Nor heavenly virtues aught avail,</l>
<l>Nor taintless innocence prevail</l>
<l>With the world’s slaves thy love to spare,</l>
<l>Nor the magic unearthly atmosphere</l>
<l>That wrapt thine ethereal form.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Such, loveliest Mary, was thy fate,</l>
<l>And such is Virtue’s doom . . . .</l>
<l>Contempt, neglect and hatred wait</l>
<l>Where yawns a wide and dreary gate</l>
<l>To drag its votaries to the tomb.</l>
<l>Sweet flower! that blooms amid the weeds</l>
<l>Where the dank serpent, interest, feeds!</l>
  </lg>
  </lg>

<lg>
<head>To the Lover of Mary</head>
<lg>
<l>Drink the exhaustless moonbeam where its glare</l>
<l>Wanly lights murdered virtue’s funeral</l>
<l>And tremulous sheds on the corpse-shrouding pall</l>
<l>A languid, languid flare . . . . .</l>
<l>Hide thee, poor Wretch, where yonder baleful yew</l>
<l>Sheds o’er the clay that now is tenantless—</l>
<l>Whose spirit once thrilled to thy warm caress—</l>
<l>Its deadly, deadly dew.</l>
<l>The moon-ray will not quench thy misery,</l>
<l>But the yew’s death-drops will bring peace to thee,</l>
<l>And yonder clay-cold grave thy bridal bed shall be.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>And since the Spirit dear that breathes of Heaven</l>
<l>Has burst the powerless bondage of its clay</l>
<l>And soars an Angel to eternal day,</l>
<l>Purged of its earthly leaven,</l>
<l>Thy yearnings now shall bend thee to the tomb,</l>
<l>Oblivion blot a life without a stain</l>
<l>And death’s cold hand round thy heart’s ceaseless pain</l>
<l>Enfold its veil of gloom.</l>
<l>The wounds shall close of Misery’s scorpion goad</l>
<l>When Mary greets thee in her blest abode</l>
<l>And worships holy Love, in purity thy God.</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>O this were joy! and such as none would fear</l>
<l>To purchase by a life of passing woe,</l>
<l>For on this earth the sickly flowers that glow</l>
<l>Breathe of perfection there.</l>
<l>Yet live—for others barter thine own bliss,</l>
<l>And living shew what towering Virtue dares</l>
<l>To accomplish even in this vale of tears:</l>
<l>Turn Hell to Paradise,</l>
<l>And spurning selfish joy soar high above</l>
<l>The Heaven of Heavens, let ever eternal *love</l>
<l>Despised awhile, thy sense of holier *Virtue prove.</l>

<l>Dares the Lama, most fleet of the Sons of the Wind,</l>
<l>The Lion to rouse from his lair?</l>
<l>When the tyger awakes, can the fast-fleeting hind</l>
<l>Repose trust in his footsteps of air?</l>
<l>No—abandoned it sinks in helpless despair;</l>
<l>The monster transfixes his prey,</l>
<l>On the sand flows its life-blood away,</l>
<l>And the rocks and the woods to the death-yells reply</l>
<l>Protracting the horrible harmony.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Yet the fowl of the desart when danger encroaches</l>
<l>Dares dreadless to perish, defending her brood,</l>
<l>Tho’ the fiercest of cloud-piercing tyrants approaches,</l>
<l>Thirsting—aye, thirsting for blood—</l>
<l>And demands, like mankind, his brother for food,</l>
<l>Yet more lenient, more gentle, than they;</l>
<l>For hunger, not glory, the prey</l>
<l>Must perish—revenge does not howl o’er the dead,</l>
<l>Nor ambition with fame bind the murderer’s head.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Tho’ weak as the Lama that bounds on the Mountains</l>
<l>And endued not with fast-fleeting footsteps of air,</l>
<l>Yet, yet will I draw from the purest of fountains,</l>
<l>Tho’ a fiercer than tygers is there,</l>
<l>Tho’ more frightful than death it scatters despair,</l>
<l>And its shadow, eclipsing the day,</l>
<l>Spreads the darkness of deepest dismay</l>
<l>O’er the withered and withering nations around</l>
<l>And the war-mangled corpses that rot on the ground.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>They came to the fountain to draw from its stream</l>
<l>Waves too poisonously lovely for mortals to see;</l>
<l>They basked for awhile in the love-darting beam</l>
<l>Then perished—and perished like me,</l>
<l>For in vain from the grasp of Religion I flee:</l>
<l>The most tenderly loved of my soul</l>
<l>Are slaves to its chilling control . . .</l>
<l>It pursues me. It blasts me. Oh! where shall I fly?</l>
<l>What remains but to curse it, to curse it and die?</l>

<l>I will kneel at thine altar, will crown thee with bays.</l>
<l>Whether God, Love or Virtue thou art,</l>
<l>Thou shalt live . . . aye! more long than these perishing lays</l>
<l>Thou shalt live in this high-beating heart.</l>
<l>Dear love! from its life-strings thou never shalt part,</l>
<l>Tho’ Prejudice clanking her chain,</l>
<l>Tho’ Interest groaning in gain,</l>
<l>May tell me thou closest to Heaven the door,</l>
<l>May tell me that thine is the way to be poor.</l>
</lg>
   <lg>
<l>The victim of merciless tyranny’s power</l>               
<l>May smile at his chains if with thee;</l>
<l>The most sense-enslaved loiterer in Passion’s sweet bower</l>
<l>Is a wretch if unhallowed by thee.</l>
<l>Thine, thine is the bond that alone binds the free.</l>
<l>Can the free worship bondage? nay, more,</l>               
<l>What they feel not, believe not, adore</l>
<l>What if felt, if believed, if existing must give</l>
<l>To thee to create, to eternize, to live.—</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
<l>For Religion more keen than the blasts of the North</l>
<l>Darts its frost thro’ the self-palsied soul;</l>      
<l>Its slaves on the work of destruction go forth;</l>
<l>The divinest emotions that roll</l>
<l>Submit to the rod of its impious control.</l>
<l>At the venemous blast of its breath</l>
<l>Love, concord, lies gasping in death,</l>               
<l>Philanthropy utters a war-drowned cry</l>
<l>And selfishness, conquering, cries Victory!</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
<l>Can we then thus tame, thus impassive behold</l>
<l>That alone whence our life springs destroyed?</l>
<l>Shall Prejudice, Priestcraft, Opinion and Gold—</l>
<l>Every passion with interest alloyed—</l>
<l>Where Love ought to reign, fill the desolate void?</l>
<l>But the Avenger arises, the throne</l>
<l>Of selfishness totters, its groan</l>
<l>Shakes the nations.—It falls, love seizes the sway;</l>
<l>The sceptre it bears unresisted away.</l>

<l>The ice mountains echo, the Baltic, the Ocean</l>
<l>Where cold sits enthroned on its solium of snow:</l>
<l>Even Spitzbergen perceives the terrific commotion.</l>
<l>The roar floats on the whirlwinds of sleet as they blow,</l>
<l>Blood clots with the streams as half frozen they flow,</l>
<l>Lurid flame o’er the cities the meteors of war</l>
<l>And mix their deep gleam with the bright polar glare.</l>

<l>Yes! the arms of Britannia victorious are bearing</l>
<l>Fame, triumph and terror wherever they spread.</l>
<l>Her Lion his crest o’er the nations is rearing,</l>
<l>Ruin follows . . . it tramples the dying and dead . . .</l>
<l>But her countrymen fall . . . the bloodreeking bed</l>
<l>Of the battle-slain sends a complaint-breathing sigh;</l>

<l>Dank carnage-smoke sheds an ensanguining glare.</l>
<l>Night its shades in the orient earlier is blending</l>
<l>Yet the light faintly marks a wild maniac’s stare.</l>
<l>She lists to the death shrieks that came on the air,</l>
<l>The pride of her heart to her bosom she prest,</l>   
<l>Then sunk on his form in the sleep of the blest.</l>

On an Icicle that clung to the grass of a grave</head>
<lg>
<l>O take the pure gem to where Southernly Breezes</l>
<l>Waft repose to some bosom as faithful as fair,</l>
<l>In which the warm current of love never freezes</l>
<l>As it circulates freely and shamelessly there,</l>
<l>Which untainted by crime, unpolluted by care,</l>
<l>Might dissolve this dear ice-drop, might bid it arise,</l>
<l>Too pure for these regions, to gleam in the skies.</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>For I found the pure gem when the daybeam returning</l>
<l>Ineffectual gleams on the snow-spangled plain,</l>
<l>When to others the longed-for arrival of morning</l>
<l>Brings relief to long night-dreams of soul-racking pain.</l>
<l>But regret is an insult. To grieve is in vain.</l>
<l>And why should we grieve that a spirit so fair</l>
<l>Sought Heaven to meet with its kindred there?</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Yet ’twas some Angel of kindness descending</l>
<l>To share in the load of Mortality’s woe,</l>
<l>Who, over thy lowly-built sepulchre bending,</l>
<l>Bade sympathy’s tenderest tear-drops to flow</l>
<l>And consigned the rich gift to the Sister of Snow;</l>
<l>And if Angels can weep, sure I may repine</l>
<l>And shed tear-drops, tho’ frozen to ice, on thy shrine.</l>

<l>Cold are the Blasts when December is howling,</l>
<l>Chill are the damps on a dying friend’s brow,</l>
<l>Stern is the Ocean when tempests are rolling,</l>
<l>Sad is the grave where a brother lies low,</l>
<l>But chillier is scorn from the false one that lov’d thee,</l>
<l>More stern is the sneer from the friend that has proved thee,</l>
<l>More sad are the tears when these sorrows have moved thee</l>
<l>That, envenomed by wildest delirium, flow.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>And alas! thou, Louisa, hast felt all this horror! . .</l>
<l>Full long the fallen Victim contended with fate</l>
<l>Till—a destitute outcast abandoned to sorrow—</l>
<l>She sought her babe’s food at her ruiner’s gate.</l>
<l>Another had charmed the remorseless betrayer;</l>
<l>He turned laughing away from her anguish-fraught prayer,</l>
<l>She spoke not, but wringing the rain from her hair,</l>
<l>Took the rough mountain path, tho’ the hour was late.</l>

<l>On the cloud-shrouded summit of dark Penmanmawr</l>
<l>The form of the wasted Louisa reclined,</l>
<l>She shrieked to the ravens loud croaking afar,</l>
<l>She sighed to the gusts of the wild sweeping wind.—</l>
<l> "Ye storms o’er the peak of the lone mountain soaring,</l>
<l>Ye clouds with the thunder-winged tempest-shafts lowering,</l>
<l>Thou wrath of black Heaven, I blame not thy pouring,</l>
<l>But thee, cruel Henry, I call thee unkind."</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Then she wreathed a wild crown from the flow’rs of the mountain,</l>
<l>And deliriously laughing the heath twigs entwined.</l>
<l>She bedewed it with tear-drops, then leaned o’er the fountain</l>
<l>And cast it a prey to the wild sweeping wind.</l>
<l> "Ah! go," she exclaimed, "where the tempest is yelling.</l>
<l>’Tis unkind to be cast on the sea that is swelling—</l>
<l>But I left, a pityless outcast, my dwelling.</l>
<l>My garments are torn—so they say is my mind."</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Not long lived Louisa.—And over her grave</l>
<l>Waved the desolate limbs of a storm-blasted yew.</l>
<l>Around it no demons or ghosts dare to rave,</l>
<l>But spirits of love steep her slumbers in dew;</l>
<l>Then stay thy swift steps mid the dark mountain heather,</l>
<l>Tho’ bleak be the scene and severe be the weather,</l>
<l>For perfidy, traveller, cannot bereave her</l>
<l>Of the tears to the tombs of the innocent due.</l>

The Parting<lb/>
Part the First.<lb/>
Scene—England
</head>

  <lg>
<head>I</head>
<l>Where are the Heroes? sunk in death they lie.</l>
<l>What toiled they for? titles and wealth and fame.</l>
<l>But the wide Heaven is now their canopy,</l>
<l>And legal murderers their loftiest name,</l>
<l>Enshrined on brass their glory and their shame</l>
<l>What tho’ torn Peace and martyred Freedom see?</l>
<l>What tho’ to most remote posterity</l>
<l>Their names, their selfishness for ay enscrolled,</l>
<l>A shuddering world’s blood-boltered eyes behold,</l>
<l>Mocking mankind’s unbettered misery?</l>
<l>Can this perfection give, can valour prove</l>
<l>One wish for others’ bliss, one throb of love . . .</l>
</lg>
<lg>  
<head>II</head>
<l>Yet darest thou boast thyself superior.—Thou!</l>
<l>Vile worm! whom lovely woman deigns to bless,</l>
<l>And, meanly selfish, bask in glory’s glow,</l>          
<l>Rending the soul-spun ties of tenderness</l>
<l>Where all desires rise for thine happiness?</l>
<l>Canst thou boast thus and hope to be forgiven?</l>
<l>Oh! when thou started’st from her last caress,</l>
<l>From purest love by vulgar Glory driven,</l>         
<l>Couldst thou have e’er deserved, if thou resigned’st, Heaven?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<head>III</head>

</lg>

<lg>
<head>IV</head>
<l><space></space></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<head>V</head>
<space></space>
<l>And shadowed by affection’s purple wing</l>
<l>Bid thee forget how Time’s fast footstep sped:</l>
<l>Would die in peace when thou wert mingled with the dead.</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<head>VI</head>
<l>Had Glory’s fire consumed each tender tie</l>           
<l>That links to love the Heaven-aspiring soul?</l>
<l>Could not that voice, quivering in agony,</l>
<l>That struggling pale resolve that dared control</l>
<l>Passion’s wild flood, when wildest it did roll,</l>
<l>Could not impassioned tenderness that burst</l>          
<l>Cold prudery’s bondage, owning all it felt—</l>
<l>Could not these, warrior, quench thy battle thirst,</l>
<l>Nought this availed thine iron-bound breast to melt,</l>
<l>To make thy footsteps pause where love and freedom dwelt?</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>VII</head>
<l>Yes! every soul-nerve vibrated . . . a space</l>     
<l>Enchained in speechless awe the warrior stood.</l>
<l>Superior reason, Virtue, manner, grace,</l>
<l>Claimed for a space their rights . . . . in varying mood</l>
<l>Before her lovely eyes in thought he stood</l>
<l>Whilst Glory’s train flashed on his mental eye</l>
<l>Which wandered wildly where the fight’s red flood,</l>
<l>The crash of death, the storm of Victory,</l>
<l>Roll round the hopes of love that only breathe to die.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>VIII</head>
<l>Then She exclaimed as love-nerved sense returned,</l>
<l>"Go . . mingle in thy country’s battle tide . . .</l>
<l>Forget that love’s pale torch hath ever burned.</l>
<l>Until thou meet’est me clothed in Victor-pride</l>
<l>May guardian spirits keep thee . . . far and wide</l>
<l>O’er the red regions of the day-scorched zone</l>
<l>For glory seek . . but here thou wilt abide—</l>
<l>Here in this breast—thou wilt abide alone.</l>
<l>I will thine empire be. My heart shall be thy throne."</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>IX</head>
<l>When Princes at fair Reason’s bidding bend,</l>
<l>Resigning power for Virtue’s fadeless meed,</l>
<l>Or spirits of Heaven to man submission lend,</l>
<l>The debt of gratitude is great indeed;</l>
<l>In vain the heart its thankfulness to prove</l>
<l>Aye might attempt to do the debt away.</l>
<l>Yet what is this compared to Woman’s love,</l>
<l>Dear Woman’s love, the dawn of Virtue’s day,</l>
<l>The bliss-inspiring beam, the soul-illuming ray?</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>X</head>
<l>Then Henry spoke as he checked the rising tear,</l>
<l>"That I have loved thee and must love for ever</l>
<l>Heaven is a witness—Heaven to whom are dear</l>
<l>The hearts that earthly chances cannot sever,</l>
<l>Where bloom the flowers that cease to blossom never.</l>
<l>Religion sanctifies the cause, I go</l>
<l>To execute its vengeance. Heaven will give</l>
<l>To me (so whispers hope) to quell the foe.</l>
<l>Heaven gives the good to conquer and to live,</l>           
<l>And thou shalt next to God his votive heart receive.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XI</head>
<l>Say, is not he the Tyrant of the World</l>
<l>And are not we the injured and the brave?</l>
<l>Unmoved shall we behold his flag unfurled,</l>
<l>Flouting with impious Wing Religion’s grave,</l>         
<l>Triumphant gleaming o’er the passive wave,</l>
<l>Nor raise an arm, nor one short pleasure yield</l>
<l>The boon of immortality to save?</l>
<l>Hope is our tempered lance, faith is our shield;</l>
<l>Conquest or death for these wait on the gory field.</l>      
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XII</head>
<l>Even at that hour when hostile myriads clash</l>
<l>And terrible death shakes his resistless dart,</l>
<l>Mingling wild wailings with the battle crash,</l>
<l>Then thou and Heaven shall share this votive heart.</l>
<l>When from pale dissolution’s grasp I start</l>
<l>(If Heaven so wills) even then will I be thine.</l>
<l>Nor can the whelming tomb have power to part</l>
<l>From all it loves a heart that loves like mine,</l>
<l>From thee . . round whom its hopes, its joys, its fears entwine."</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XIII</head>
<l>A sicklier tint crept o’er Louisa’s cheek . . . .</l>
<l> "But thou art dearer far to me than all</l>
<l>That fancy’s visions feign, or tongue can speak.</l>
<l>Yes! may I die, and be that death eternal,</l>
<l>When other thoughts but thee my soul enthrall.</l>
<l>The joys of Heaven I prize thee far above,</l>
<l>Thee, dearest, will my Soul its Saviour call.</l>
<l>My faith is thine . . my faith-gained heaven, thy love;</l>
<l>My Hell, when cruel fates thee from these arms remove.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XIV</head>
<l>Farewell" . . . she spoke. The warrior’s war-steeled breast,</l>
<l>Quivering in feeling’s agonized excess,</l>              
<l>Scarce drew its breath, to sickliness oppressed</l>
<l>By mingled self-reproach and tenderness;</l>
<l>He dared not speak, but rushed from her caress.</l>
<l>The sunny glades; the little birds of spring</l>
<l>Twittering from every garlanded recess,</l>             
<l>Returning verdure’s joy that seem’d to sing</l>
<l>Whilst woe with stern hand smote his every mental string;</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XV</head>
<l>The fragrant dew-mists from the Ivied Thorn</l>
<l>Whose form o’ershadowed love’s most blissful bower,</l>
<l>Where oft would fly the tranquil time of morn,</l>   
<l>Or swifter urge its flight dear evening’s hour,</l>
<l>When purple twilight in the East would lower</l>
<l>And the amorous starbeam kiss the loveliest form</l>
<l>That ever bruised a pleasure-fainting flower</l>
<l>Whose emanative eyebeam, thrilling, warm,</l>
<l>Around her sacred presence shed a rapturing charm;</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XVI</head>
<l>Each object so beloved, each varied tone</l>
<l>Of heavenly feeling that can never die,</l>
<l>Each little throb his heart had ever known</l>
<l>Impetuous rushed on fainting memory.</l>
<l>Yet not alone for parted extacy,</l>
<l>To which he now must bid a long adieu,</l>
<l>Started the bitter tear or burst the sigh;</l>
<l>In all the pangs that, spite concealment, grew</l>
<l>O’er his Louisa’s peace, a deeper soul-pang drew.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XVII</head>
<l>The balmy breath of soul-reviving dawn</l>
<l>That kissed the bosom of the waveless lake,</l>
<l>Scented with spring-flowers, o’er the level lawn</l>
<l>Struck on his sense, to woe scarce yet awake.</l>
<l>He felt its still reproach, the upland brake</l>
<l>Rustled beneath his war-steed’s eager prance,</l>
<l>Hastening to Egypt’s shore his way to take,</l>
<l>But swifter hastening to dispel the trance</l>
<l>Of grief, he hurried on, smothering the last sad glance.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XVIII</head>
<l>Sweet flower! in dereliction’s solitude</l>
<l>That scatterest perfume to the unheeding gale</l>
<l>And in the grove’s unconscious quietude</l>
<l>Murmurest (thyself scarce conscious) thy sad tale—</l>
<l>Sure it is subject for the Poet’s wail,</l>
<l>Tho’ faint, that one so worthy to be prized,</l>       
<l>The fairest flower of the loveliest vale,</l>
<l>To withering Glory should be sacrifized,</l>
<l>That hides his hateful form in Virtue’s garb disguised.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XIX</head>
<l>Religion! hated cause of all the woe</l>
<l>That makes the world this wilderness. Thou spring</l>
<l>Whence terror, pride, revenge and perfidy flow,</l>
<l>The curses which thy pampered minions bring</l>
<l>On thee shall Virtue’s votary fear to fling?</l>
<l>And thou, dear Love! thy tender ties to sever,</l>
<l>To drown in shouts thy bliss-fraught murmuring,</l>
<l>Ceaseless shall selfish Prejudice endeavour?</l>
<l>Shall she succeed? . . oh no, whilst I live, never, never!</l>          
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XX</head>
<l>For by the wrongs that flaming deep</l>
<l>Within this bosom’s agony,</l>
<l>That dry the source whence others weep,—</l>
<l>I swear that thou shalt die!</l>
  </lg>

Henry and Louisa<lb/>
The Meeting<lb/>
Part Second
</head>   

<lg>
<head>I</head>
<l>’Tis night . . No planet’s brilliance dares to light</l>
<l>The dim and battle-blushing scenery,</l>
<l>Friends mixed with foes urge unremitting fight</l>
<l>Beneath War’s suffocating canopy,</l>                  
<l>And, as sulphureous meteors fire the sky,</l>
<l>Fast flash the deathful thunderbolts of War,</l>
<l>Whilst groans unite in frightful harmony</l>
<l>And wakened vultures shrieking from afar</l>
<l>Scent their half-murdered prey amid the battle’s jar.</l>
 </lg>
  <lg>
<head>II</head>
<l>Now had the Genius of the south, sublime</l>
<l>On mighty Atlas’ tempest-cinctured throne,</l>
<l>Looked over Afric’s desolated clime,</l>
<l>Deep wept at slavery’s everlasting moan</l>
<l>And his most dear-beloved nation’s groan.</l>
<l>The Boreal whirlwind’s shadowy wings that sweep</l>
<l>The veined bosom of the northern world</l>
<l>That hears contending thunders on the deep,</l>
<l>Sees hostile flags on Egypt’s strand unfurled,</l>
<l>Brings Egypt’s faintest groan to waste and ruin hurled.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>III</head>
<l>Is this then all that sweeps the midnight sand?</l>
<l>Tells the wild blast no tales of deeper woe?</l>
<l>Does war alone pollute the unhappy land?</l>
<l>No—the low fluttering and the hectic glow</l>
<l>Of hope, whose sickly flowret scarce can blow,</l>           
<l>Chilled by the ice-blast of intense despair;</l>
<l>Anguish that dries the big tear ere it flow,</l>
<l>And maniac love, that sits by the beacon’s glare</l>
<l>With eyes on nothing fixed, dim like a mist-clothed star.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>IV</head>
<l>No fear save one could daunt her—Ocean’s wave,</l>             
<l>Bearing Britannia’s hired asassins on</l>
<l>To victory’s shame or an unhonored grave,</l>
<l>Beheld Louisa mid an host alone.</l>
<l>The womanly dress that veiled her fair form is gone,</l>
<l>Gone is the timid wandering of her eye,</l>
<l>Pale firmness nerved her anguished heart to stone;</l>
<l>The sense of shame, the flush of modesty,</l>
<l>By stern resolve were quenched or only glowed to die.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>V</head>
<l> "Where is my love—my Henry—is he dead?"</l>
<l>Half-drowned in smothered anguish wildly burst</l> 
<l>From her parched lips—"is my ador’d one dead?</l>
<l>Knows none my Henry? War! thou source accurst</l>
<l>In whose red flood I see these sands immerst,</l>
<l>Hast thou quite whelmed compassion’s tearful spring</l>
<l>Where thy fierce tide rolls to slake Glory’s thirst?</l>
<l>Perhaps thou, Warrior, some kind word dost bring</l>
<l>From my poor Henry’s lips when Death its shade did fling."</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>VI</head>
<l>A tear of pity dimmed the Warrior’s gaze.</l>
<l> "I know him not, sweet maiden, yet the fight</l>
<l>That casts on Britain’s fame a brighter blaze</l>
<l>Should spare all yours, if ought I guess aright.</l>
<l>But ah! by yonder flash of sulphurous light</l>
<l>The dear loved work of battle has begun.</l>
<l>Fame calls her votaries." He fled. The night</l>
<l>Had far advanced before the fray was done;</l>
<l>Scarce sunk the roar of war before the rising Sun.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>VII</head>
<l>But sight of wilder grief where slept the dead</l>
<l>Was witnessed by the morn’s returning glow,</l>
<l>When frantic o’er the waste Louisa sped</l>
<l>To drink her dying lover’s latest vow:</l>
<l>Sighed mid her locks the sea-gales as they blew,</l>
<l>Bearing along faint shrieks of dying men</l>
<l>As if they sympathized with her deep woe.</l>
<l>Silent she paused a space, and then again</l>
<l>New-nerved by fear and hope sprang wild across the plain.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>VIII</head>
<l>See where she stops again! . . . a ruin’s shade</l>
<l>Darkens his fading lineaments, his cheek</l>
<l>On which remorseful pain is deep pourtrayed</l>
<l>Glares, death-convulsed and ghastly. Utterings break—</l>
<l>Shuddering, unformed—his tongue essays to speak.</l>
<l>There low he lies! poor Henry! where is now</l>
<l>Thy dear, deserted love? Is there no friend</l>
<l>To bathe with tears that anguish-burning brow,</l>
<l>None comfort in this fearful hour to lend,</l>
<l>When to remorseful grief thy parting spirits bend?</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>IX</head>
<l>Yes! pain had steeped each dying limb in flame</l>
<l>When, mad with mingled hope and pale dismay,</l>
<l>Fleet as the wild deer his Louisa came,</l>
<l>Nerved by distraction.—A pale tremulous ray</l>
<l>Flashed on her eyes from the expiring day.</l>
<l>Life for a space rushed to his fainting breast.</l>
<l>The breathing form of love-enlivened clay</l>
<l>In motionless rapture pale Louisa prest</l>
<l>And stung by maddening hope in tears her bliss exprest.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>X</head>
<l>Yet was the transport wavering . . . the dew</l>              
<l>Of bodily pain that bathed his pallid brow,</l>
<l>The pangs that thro’ his anguished members flew,</l>
<l>Tho’ half subdued by Love’s returning glow,</l>
<l>Doubt mixed with lingering hope must needs bestow.</l>
<l>Then she exclaimed—"Love, I have sought thee far,</l>
<l>Whence our own Albion’s milder sea gales blow</l>
<l>To this stern scene of fame-aspiring war;</l>
<l>Thro’ waves of danger past thou wert my polar star.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XI</head>
<l>Live then, dear source of life! and let the ray</l>
<l>Which lights thy kindling eyebeam softly speak</l>
<l>That thou hast loved when I was far away—</l>
<l>Yet thou art pale. Death’s hectic lights thy cheek.</l>
<l>Oh! if one moment fate the chain should break</l>
<l>Which binds thy soul unchangeably to mine:</l>
<l>Another moment’s pain fate dare not wreak.</l>
<l>Another moment . . . . . I am ever thine!</l>
<l>Love, turn those eyes on me! ah, death has dimmed their shine."</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XII</head>
<l>Ceased her voice. The accents mild</l>
<l>In frightful stillness died away.</l>
<l>More sweet than Memnon’s plainings wild</l>   
<l>That float upon the morning ray</l>
<l>Died every sound . . save when</l>
<l>At distance o’er the plain</l>
<l>Britannia’s legions swiftly sweeping,</l>
<l>Glory’s ensanguined harvest reaping,</l>
<l>Mowed down the field of men,</l>
<l>And the silent ruins, crumbling nigh,</l>
<l>With echoes low prolonged the cry</l>
<l>Of mingled defeat and victory.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XIII</head>
<l>More low, more faint yet far more dread</l> 
<l>Arose the expiring warrior’s groan,</l>
<l>Stretched on the sand, his bloody bed,</l>
<l>In agonized death was Henry laid</l>
<l>But he did not fall alone . . .</l>
<l>Why then that anguished sigh</l>
<l>Which seems to tear the vital tie,</l>
<l>Fiercer than death; more fell</l>
<l>Than tyranny, contempt or hate?</l>
<l>Why does that breast with horror swell</l>
<l>Which ought to triumph over fate?</l>
<l>Why? ask the pallid, griefworn mien</l>
<l>Of poor Louisa, let it speak:</l>
<l>But her firm heart would sooner break</l>
<l>Than doubt the soul where love had been.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XIV</head>
<l>Now, now he dies! his parting breath,</l>
<l>The sulphurous gust of battle bears.</l>
<l>The shriek, the groan, the gasp of death,</l>
<l>Unmoved Louisa hears,</l>
<l>And a smile of triumph lights her eye</l>
<l>With more than mortal radiancy.—</l>
<l>Sacred to Love a deed is done!—</l>
<l>Gleams thro’ battle clouds the Sun,</l>
<l>Gleams it on all that’s good and fair</l>
<l>Stretched on the Earth to moulder there.</l>
<l>Shall Virtue perish? No;</l>
<l>Superior to Religion’s tie,</l>
<l>Emancipate from misery,</l>
<l>Despising self, their souls can know</l>
<l>All the delight love can bestow</l>
<l>Where Glory’s phantom fades away</l>
<l>Before Affection’s purer ray,</l>
<l>When tyrants cease to wield the rod</l>
<l>And slaves to tremble at their nod.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<head>XV</head>
<l>There near the stunted palms that shroud</l>
<l>The spot from which their spirits fled</l> 
<l>Shall pause the human hounds of blood</l>
<l>And own a secret dread.</l>
<l>There shall the victor’s steel-clad brow,</l>
<l>Tho’ flushed by conquest’s crimson glow,</l>
<l>Be changed with inward fear;</l>
<l>There stern and steady by long command</l>
<l>The pomp-fed despot’s sceptered hand</l>
<l>Shall shake as if death were near,</l>
<l>Whilst the lone captive in his train</l>
<l>Feels comfort as he shakes his chain.</l>

*The stanza of this Poem is radically that of Spencer altho’ I suffered myself at the time of writing it to be led into occasional deviations.  These defects I do not alter now, being unwilling to offer any outrage to the living portraiture of my own mind; bad as it may be pronounced.

<head>A Translation of<lb/> 
The Marsellois Hymn</head>
<lg>
<l>Haste to battle, Patriot Band!</l>
<l>A day of Glory dawns on thee!</l>
<l>Against thy rights is raised an hand:—</l>
<l>The bloodred hand of tyranny!</l>
<l>See! the ferocious slaves of power</l>
<l>Across the wasted country scour</l>
<l>And in thy very arms destroy</l>
<l>The pledges of thy nuptial joy—</l>
<l>Thine unresisting family!</l>
</lg>
      <lg>
<head>Chorus</head>
<l>Then citizens, form in battle array,</l>  
<l>For this is the dawn of a glorious day.</l>
<l>March, march, fearless of danger and toil,</l>
<l>And the rank gore of tyrants shall water your soil!</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>What wills the coward, traitorous train</l>
<l>Of Kings, whose trade is perfidy?</l>
<l>For whom is forged this hateful chain,</l>
<l>For whom prepared this slavery?</l>
<l>For you. On you their vengeance rests . . .</l>
<l>What transports ought to thrill your breasts!</l>
<l>Frenchmen! this unhallowed train</l>         
<l>To ancient woe would bind again</l>
<l>Those souls whom valour has made free!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Chorus &#38;c.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>What! shall foreign bands compel</l>
<l>Us to the laws of tyranny?</l>
<l>Shall hired soldiers hope to quell</l>
<l>The arm upraised for liberty?</l>
<l>Great God! by these united arms</l>
<l>Shall despots, their own alarms,</l>
<l>Pass neath the yoke made for our head!</l>
<l>Yea! pomp-fed Kings shall quake with dread—</l>
<l>These masters of Earth’s destiny!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
 <l>Chorus &#38;c.</l> 
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Tremble, Kings! despised of Man!</l>
<l>Ye traitors to your country,</l>
<l>Tremble! your parricidal plan</l>
<l>At length shall meet its destiny.</l>
<l>We all are soldiers fit for fight,</l>
<l>But if we sink in glory’s night</l>
<l>Our Mother Earth will give ye new</l>
<l>The brilliant pathway to pursue</l>
<l>That leads to Death or Victory!</l>
</lg>
      <lg>
<l>Chorus &#38;c.</l> 
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Frenchmen! on the guilty brave</l>
<l>Pour your vengeful energy.—</l>
<l>Yet in your triumph, pitying save</l>
<l>The unwilling slaves of tyranny;</l>
<l>But let the gore-stained despots bleed,</l>    
<l>Be death fell Bouillé’s bloodhound-meed;</l>

<lg> 
<head>Written in very early youth</head>
<lg>
<l>I’ll lay me down by the church-yard tree</l>
<l>And resign me to my destiny;</l>
<l>I’ll bathe my brow with the poison dew</l>
<l>That falls from yonder deadly yew,</l>
<l>And if it steal my soul away</l>
<l>To bid it wake in realms of day,</l>
<l>Spring’s sweetest flowers shall never be</l>
<l>So dear to gratitude and me!</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l>Earthborn glory cannot breathe</l>
<l>Within the damp recess of death;</l>
<l>Avarice, Envy, Lust, Revenge</l>
<l>Suffer there a fearful change;</l>
<l>All that grandeur ever gave</l>
<l>Moulders in the silent grave.</l>
<l>Oh! that I slept near yonder yew,</l>
<l>That this tired frame might moulder too!</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l>Yet Pleasure’s folly is not mine,</l>
<l>No votarist I at Glory’s shrine;</l>
<l>The sacred gift for which I sigh</l>
<l>Is not to live to feel alone—</l>
<l>I only ask to calmly die,</l>
<l>That the tomb might melt this heart of stone</l>
<l>To love beyond the grave.</l>
  </lg>
</lg>
    
    <lg>
<head>Zeinab and Kathema</head>
<lg>
<l>Upon the lonely beach Kathema lay;</l>
<l>Against his folded arm his heart beat fast.</l>
<l>Thro’ gathering tears the Sun’s departing ray</l>
<l>In coldness o’er his shuddering spirit past,</l>
<l>And all unfelt the breeze of evening came</l>
<l>That fanned with quivering wing his wan cheek’s feeble flame.</l> 
</lg>
      <lg>
<l> "Oh!" cried the mourner, "could this widowed soul</l>
<l> "But fly where yonder Sun now speeds to dawn."</l>
<l>He paused—a thousand thoughts began to roll;</l>
<l>Like waves they swept in restless tumult on,</l>
<l>Like those fast waves that quick-succeeding beat</l>
<l>Without one lasting shape the beach beneath his feet.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>And now the beamless, broad and yellow sphere</l>
<l>Half sinking lingered on the crimson sea;</l>
<l>A shape of darksome distance does appear</l>
<l>Within its semicircled radiancy.</l>
<l>All sense was gone to his betrothed one—</l>
<l>His eye fell on the form that dimmed the setting sun,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>He thought on his betrothed . . . for his youth</l>
<l>With her that was its charm to ripeness grew.</l>
<l>All that was dear in love, or fair in truth</l>
<l>With her was shared as childhood’s moments flew,</l>
<l>And mingled with sweet memories of her</l>
<l>Was life’s unveiling morn with all its bliss and care.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>O wild and lovely Superstition’s spell¬¬—</l>
<l>Love for the friend that life and freedom gave;</l>
<l>Youth’s growing hopes that watch themselves so well,</l>
<l>Passion so prompt to blight, so strong to save</l>
<l>And childhood’s host of memories combine</l>
<l>Her life and love around his being to entwine,</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>And to their wishes with its joy-mixed pain.</l>
<l>Just as the veil of hope began to fall,</l>
<l>The Christian murderers over-ran the plain,</l>
<l>Ravaging, burning and polluting all.</l>
<l>Zeinab was reft to grace the robbers’ land;</l>         
<l>Each drop of kindred blood stained the invaders’ brand.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Yes! they had come their holy book to bring,</l>
<l>Which God’s own son’s apostles had compiled</l>
<l>That charity and peace, and love might spring</l>
<l>Within a world by God’s blind ire defiled,</l>     
<l>But rapine, war and treachery rushed before</l>
<l>Their hosts, and murder dyed Kathema’s bower in gore.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Therefore his soul was widowed, and alone</l>
<l> He stood in the world’s wide and drear expanse.</l>
<l>No human ear could shudder at his groan,</l>
<l>  No heart could thrill with his unspeaking glance;</l>
<l>One only hope yet lingering dared to burn,</l>
<l>Urging to high emprize and deeds that danger spurn.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>The glow has failed on Ocean’s western line,</l>
<l>Faded from every moveless cloud above.</l>
<l>The moon is up—she that was wont to shine</l>
<l>And bless thy childish nights of guileless love,</l>
<l>Unhappy one, ere Christian rapine tore</l>
<l>All ties, and stain’d thy hopes in a dear mother’s gore.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>The form that in the setting Sun was seen</l>         
<l>Now in the moonlight slowly nears the shore,</l>
<l>The white sails gleaming o’er the billows green</l>
<l>That sparkle into foam its prow before,</l>
<l>A wanderer of the deep it seems to be,</l>
<l>On high adventures bent, and feats of chivalry.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Then hope and wonder filled the mourner’s mind.</l>
<l>He gazed till vision even began to fail,</l>
<l>When to the pulses of the evening wind</l>
<l>A little boat approaching gave its sail,</l>
<l>Rode o’er the slow-raised surges near the strand,</l>    
<l>Ran up the beach and gave some stranger men to land.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l> "If thou wilt bear me to far England’s shore</l>
<l>Thine is this heap—the Christian’s God!"</l>
<l>The chief with gloating rapture viewed the ore</l>
<l>And his pleased avarice gave the willing nod.</l>       
<l>They reach the ship, the fresh’ning breezes rise</l>
<l>And smooth and fast they speed beneath the moonlight skies.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>What heart e’er felt more ardent longings now?</l>
<l>What eye than his e’er beamed with riper hope</l>
<l>As curbed impatience on his open brow</l>
<l>There painted fancy’s unsuspected scope,</l>
<l>As all that’s fair the foreign land appeared</l>
<l>By ever-present love, wonder and hope endeared?</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Meanwhile thro’ calm and storm, thro’ night and day,</l>
<l>Unvarying in her aim the vessel went</l>
<l>As if some inward spirit ruled her way</l>
<l>And her tense sails were conscious of intent,</l>
<l>Till Albion’s cliffs gleamed o’er her plunging bow</l>
<l>And Albion’s river-floods bright sparkled round her prow.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Then on the land in joy Kathema leaped</l>
<l>And kissed the soil in which his hopes were sown—</l>
<l>These even now in thought his heart has reaped.</l>
<l>Elate of body and soul he journeyed on,</l>
<l>And the strange things of a strange land past by</l>
<l>Like motes and shadows prest upon his charmed eye.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Yet Albion’s changeful skies and chilling wind</l>
<l>The change from Cashmire’s vale might well denote:</l>
<l>There, Heaven and Earth are ever bright and kind;</l>
<l>Here, blights and storms and damp forever float,</l>
<l>Whilst hearts are more ungenial than the zone—</l> 
<l>Gross, spiritless, alive to no pangs but their own.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>There flowers and fruits are ever fair and ripe;</l>
<l>Autumn there mingles with the bloom of spring</l>
<l>And forms unpinched by frost or hunger’s gripe</l>
<l>A natural veil o’er natural spirits fling;</l>
<l>Here, woe on all but wealth has set its foot.</l>
<l>Famine, disease and crime even wealth’s proud gates pollute.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Unquiet death and premature decay,</l>
<l>Youth tottering on the crutches of old age,</l>
<l>And ere the noon of manhood’s riper day,</l>
<l>Pangs that no art of medicine can assuage,</l>
<l>Madness and passion ever mingling flames,</l>
<l>And souls that well become such miserable frames—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>These are the bribes which Art to man has given</l>
<l>To yield his taintless nature to her sway.</l>   
<l>So might dark night with meteors tempt fair Heaven</l>
<l>To blot the sunbeam and forswear the day</l>
<l>Till gleams of baleful light alone might shew</l>
<l>The pestilential mists, the darkness and the woe.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Kathema little felt the sleet and wind,</l>          
<l>He little heeded the wide-altered scene;</l>
<l>The flame that lived within his eager mind</l>
<l>There kindled all the thoughts that once had been.</l>
<l>He stood alone in England’s varied woe</l>
<l>Safe, mid the flood of crime that round his steps did flow.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>It was an evening when the bitterest breath</l>
<l>Of dark December swept the mists along</l>
<l>That the lone wanderer came to a wild heath.</l>
<l>Courage and hope had staid his nature long;</l>
<l>Now cold, and unappeased hunger spent</l>
<l>His strength; sensation failed in total languishment.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>When he awaked to life cold horror crept</l>
<l>Even to his heart, for a damp deathy smell</l>
<l>Had slowly come around him while he slept.</l>
<l>He started . . . lo! the fitful moonbeams fell</l>
<l>Upon a dead and naked female form</l>
<l>That from a gibbet high swung to the sullen storm</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>And wildly in the wind its dark hair swung,</l>
<l>Low mingling with the clangor of the chain,</l>
<l>Whilst ravenous birds of prey that on it clung</l>       
<l>In the dull ear of night poured their sad strain</l>
<l>And ghastlily her shapeless visage shone</l>
<l>In the unsteady light, half mouldered thro’ the bone.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Then madness seized Kathema, and his mind</l>
<l>A prophecy of horror filled. He scaled</l>        
<l>The gibbet which swung slowly in the wind</l>
<l>High o’er the heath.—Scarcely his strength avail’d</l>
<l>To grasp the chain, when by the moonlight’s gleam</l>
<l>His palsied gaze was fixed on Zeinab’s altered frame.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Yes! in those orbs once bright with life and love</l>
<l>Now full-fed worms bask in unnatural light;</l>
<l>That neck on which his eyes were wont to rove</l>
<l>In rapture, changed by putrefaction’s blight,</l>
<l>Now rusts the ponderous links that creak beneath</l>
<l>Its weight, and turns to life the frightful sport of death.</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Then in the moonlight played Kathema’s smile</l>
<l>Calmly.—In peace his spirit seemed to be.</l>
<l>He paused, even like a man at ease awhile,</l>
<l>Then spoke—"My love! I will be like to thee,</l>
<l>A mouldering <sic>carcase</sic> or a spirit blest,</l>
<l>With thee corruption’s prey, or Heaven’s happy guest."</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>He twined the chain around his neck, then leaped</l>
<l>Forward, in haste to meet the life to come.</l>
<l>An iron-souled son of Europe might have wept</l>
<l>To witness such a noble being’s doom</l>
<l>As on the death-scene Heaven indignant frowned</l>
<l>And Night in horror drew her veil the deed around.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>For they had torn his Zeinab from her home,</l>
<l>Her innocent habits were all rudely shriven;</l>
<l>And, dragged to live in love’s untimely tomb,</l>
<l>To prostitution, crime and woe was driven.</l>
<l>The human race seemed leagued against her weal,</l>
<l>And indignation cased her naked heart in steel.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Therefore against them she waged ruthless war</l>
<l>With their own arms of bold and bloody crime,—</l>
<l>Even like a mild and sweetly-beaming star</l>
<l>Whose rays were wont to grace the matin-prime</l>
<l>Changed to a comet, horrible and bright,</l>
<l>Which wild careers awhile then sinks in dark-red night.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l>Thus, like its God, unjust and pityless,</l>
<l>Crimes first are made and then avenged by Man,</l>
<l>For where’s the tender heart, whose hope can bless</l>
<l>Or man’s, or God’s, unprofitable plan—</l>
<l>A universe of horror and decay,</l>
<l>Gibbets, disease, and wars and hearts as hard as they.</l>

<l> To check the chariot of the year</l>

<l> And ere entombed within her maw,</l>
<l> To drag them to the light of morn</l>
<l> And mark each feature with an eye</l>
<l> Of cold &#38; fearless scrutiny . . . .</l>
<l> It asks a soul not formed to feel</l>
<l> An eye of glass, a hand of steel;</l>
<l> Thoughts that have passed &#38; thoughts that are</l>
<l> With truth and feeling to compare;</l>
<l> A scene which wildered fancy viewed</l>          
<l> In the souls coldest solitude;</l>
<l> With that same scene when peaceful love</l>

       </lg>
      <lg>
<l> The moonlight was my dearer day:—</l>
<l> Then would I wander far away</l>
<l> And lingering on the wild brook’s shore</l>          
<l> To hear its unremitting roar</l>
<l> Would lose in the ideal flow</l>
<l> All sense of overwhelming woe</l>
<l> Or at the noiseless noon of night</l>
<l> Would climb some heathy mountain’s height</l> 
<l> And listen to the mystic sound</l>
<l> That stole in fitful gasps around.</l>
<l> I joyed to see the streaks of day</l>
<l> Above the purple peaks decay</l>
<l> And watch the latest line of light</l>
<l> Just mingling with the shades of night</l>
<l> For day with me, was time of woe</l>
<l> When even tears refused to flow</l>
<l> Then would I stretch my languid frame</l>
<l> Beneath the wild-woods gloomiest shade</l>      
<l> And try to quench the ceaseless flame</l>
<l> That on my withered vitals preyed;</l>
<l> Would close mine eyes &#38; dream I were</l>
<l> On some remote &#38; friendless plain</l>
<l> And long to leave existence there</l>
<l> If with it I might leave the pain</l>
<l> That with a finger cold &#38; lean</l>
<l> Wrote madness on my withering mien</l> 
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l> It was not unrequited love</l>
<l> That bade my wildered spirit rove;</l>
<l>’Twas not the pride disdaining life</l>
<l> That with this mortal world at strife</l>
<l> Would yield to the souls inward sense</l>
<l> Then groan in human impotence,</l>
<l> And weep, because it is not given</l>
<l> To taste on Earth the peace of Heaven,</l>
<l>’Twas not, that in the narrow sphere</l>
<l> Where Nature fixed my wayward fate</l>
<l> There was no friend or kindred dear</l>
<l> Formed to become that spirit’s mate,</l>   
<l> Which searching on tired pinion found</l>
<l> Barren &#38; cold repulse around . . . .</l>
<l> Ah no! yet each one sorrow gave</l>
<l> New graces to the narrow grave:</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
<l> For broken vows had early quelled</l>     
<l> The stainless spirit’s vestal flame</l>
<l> Yes! whilst the faithful bosom swelled</l>
<l> Then the envenomed arrow came</l>
<l> And apathy’s unaltering eye</l>
<l> Beamed coldness on the misery,</l>
<l> And early I had learned to scorn</l>
<l> The chains of clay that bound a soul</l>
<l> Panting to seize the wings of morn</l>
<l> And where it's vital fires were born</l>
<l> To soar &#38; spurn the cold control</l>  
<l> Which the vile slaves of earthly night</l>
<l> Would twine around its struggling flight</l>
<l> O many were the friends whom fame</l>

<l> I love thee Baby! for thine own sweet sake:</l>
<l> Those azure eyes, that faintly dimpled cheek</l>
<l> Thy tender frame so eloquently weak</l>
<l> Love in the sternest heart of hate might wake;</l>
<l> But more, when o’er thy fitful slumber bending</l>
<l> Thy mother folds thee to her wakeful heart,</l>
<l> Whilst love &#38; pity in her glances blending,</l>
<l> All that thy passive eyes can feel, impart;</l>
<l> More, when some feeble lineaments of her</l>
<l> Who bore thy weight beneath her spotless bosom</l>
<l> As with deep love I read thy face, recur,</l>
<l> More dear art thou &#244; fair &#38; fragile blossom,</l>
<l> Dearest, when most thy tender traits express</l>
<l> The image of thy Mother’s loveliness.—</l>

<lg>
<l> O thou bright Sun! beneath the dark blue line</l>
<l> Of western distance that sublime descendest,</l>
<l> And gleaming lovelier as thy beams decline</l>
<l> Thy million hues to every vapour lendest,</l>
<l> And over cobweb lawn &#38; grove &#38; stream</l>    
<l> Sheddest the liquid magic of thy light,</l>
<l> Till calm Earth with the parting splendor bright</l>
<l> Shews like the vision of a beauteous dream,</l>
<l> What gazer now with astronomic eye</l>
<l> Could coldly count the spots within thy sphere?</l> 
<l> Such were thy lover, Harriet, could he fly</l>
<l> The thoughts of all that makes his passion dear</l>

<head>To Harriett</head>
<lg>
<l> Thy look of love has power to calm</l>
<l> The stormiest passion of my Soul</l>
<l> Thy gentle words are drops of balm</l>
<l> In lifes too bitter bowl</l>
<l> No grief is mine but that alone</l>
<l> These choicest blessings I have known</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l> Harriett! if all who long to live</l>
<l> In the warm sunshine of thine eye</l>
<l> That price beyond all pain must give</l>
<l> Beneath thy scorn to die</l>
<l> Then hear thy chosen own too late</l>
<l> His heart most worthy of thy hate</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> Be thou then one among mankind</l>
<l> Whose heart is harder not for state</l>
<l> Thou only virtuous gentle kind</l>
<l> Amid a world of hate</l>
<l> And by a slight endurance seal</l>
<l> A fellow beings lasting weal</l>

<l> For pale with anguish is his cheek</l>
<l> His breath comes fast his eyes are dim</l>
<l> Thy name is struggling ere he speak</l>
<l> Weak is each trembling limb</l>
<l> In mercy let him not endure</l>
<l> The misery of a fatal cure</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l> O trust for once no erring guide</l>
<l> Bid the remorseless feeling flee</l>
<l> Tis malice tis revenge tis pride</l>
<l> Tis any thing but thee</l>

<head>May 1813: To Harriet . . . . . . . . .</head> 
<lg>
<l> Oh Harriet love like mine that glows</l>
<l> What rolling years can e’er destroy</l>
<l> Without thee can I tell my woes</l>
<l> And with thee can I speak my grief</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l> Ah no past all the futile power</l>
<l> Of words to tell is love like mine</l>
<l> My love is not the fading flower</l>
<l> That fleets ere it attains its prime</l>
<l> A moment of delight with thee</l>
<l> Would pay me for an age of pain</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> I’ll tell not of Rapture and Joy</l>
<l> Which swells thro’ the Libertines frame</l>
<l> That breast must feel bliss with alloy</l>
<l> That is scorched by so selfish a flame</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> It were pleasure to die for my love</l>
<l> It were rapture to sink in the grave</l>
<l> My eternal affection to prove</l>
<l> My ever dear Harriet to save</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> Without thee all pleasure were gloom</l>
<l> And with thee all sorrow were joy</l>
<l> Ere I knew thee my Harriet each year</l>
<l> Passed in mournful rotation away</l>
<l> No friend to my bosom was dear</l>
<l> Slow rolled the unvarying day</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> Shall I wake then those horrors anew</l>    
<l> That swelled in my desperate brain</l>
<l> When to deaths darkened portals I flew</l>
<l> And sought miseries relief to my pain</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> That hour which tears thee from me</l>
<l> Leaves nothing but death and despair</l> 
<l> And that Harriet never could be</l>
<l> Were thy mind less enchantingly fair</l> 
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> Tis not for the charms of thy form</l>
<l> Which decay with the swift rolling years</l>
<l> Ah no Heaven expands to my sight</l>

<head>"Late was the night"</head>
<lg>
<l> Late was the night the moon shone bright</l>
<l> It teinted the <sic> wals</sic> with a silver light</l>
<l> And threw its wide uncertain beam</l>
<l> Upon its rolling mountain stream</l>
</lg>
  <lg>
<l> That stream so swift that rushes along</l>       
<l> Has oft been dyed by the murderes song</l>
<l> It oft has heard the exulting wave</l>
<l> Of one who oft the murderes braved</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> The Alpine summits which raised on high</l>
<l> Peacefully frown on the Valley beneath</l>
<l> And lift their Huge forms to the Sky</l>
<l> Oft have heard the voices of death</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> Now not a murmur floats on the air</l>
<l> Save the distant sounds of the torrents tide</l>
<l> Not a cloud obscures the moors so fair</l>  
<l> Not a shade is seen on the rocks to glide</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> See that fair form that leans ore</l>
<l> Her garments are tattered her bosom so bare</l>

Febry 28th 1805 To St Irvyne</head>
<lg>
<l> Oer thy turrets St Irvyne the winter winds roar</l>
<l> The long grass of thy Towers streams to the blast</l>
<l> Must I never St Irvyne then visit thee more</l>
<l> Are those visions of transient happiness past</l> 
</lg>
  <lg>
<l> When with Harriet I sat on the mouldering height</l>
<l> When with Harriet I gazed on the star spangled sky</l>
<l> And the August Moon shone thro’ the dimness of night</l>
<l> How swiftly the moment of pleasure fled by.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> How swift is a fleeting smile chased by a sigh</l>
<l> This breast this poor sorrow torn breast must confess</l>
<l> Oh Harriet, loved Harriet tho’ thou art not nigh</l>
<l> Think not thy lover thinks of thee less.</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> How oft have we roamed thro’ the stillness of Eve</l>
<l> Through St Irvyne’s old rooms that so fast fade away</l>
<l> That those pleasure winged moments were transient I grieve</l>
<l> My Soul like those turrets falls fast to decay</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> My Harriet is fled like a fast fading dream</l>
<l> Which fades ere the vision is fixed on the mind</l>
<l> But has left a firm love &#38; a lasting esteem</l>
<l> That my soul to her soul must eternally bind</l>
  </lg>
  <lg>
<l> When my mouldering bones lie in the cold chilling grave</l>
<l> When my last groans are borne oer Strood's wide lea</l>
<l> And over my Tomb the chill night tempests rave</l>
<l> Then loved Harriet bestow one poor thought on me</l>
