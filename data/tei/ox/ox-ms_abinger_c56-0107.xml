    May this be the last misfortune that 
    you will ever suffer- live &#x26; be happy
    to make of others so.
    As We returned Elizabeth said, You
    do not know, my dear Victor, w how
    much I am relieved now that I trust
    in the innocence of this unfortunate
    girl. I never could again have
    known peace if I had been deceived
    in my reliance on her. For the mo
    ment that I did believe it I felt
    such anguish that I could not have
    long sustained how my heart is light
    ened. The innocent suffers- but she
    whom I thought amiable and good
    is not wicked and I am consoled."
    Amiable Sweet Cousin! Such were your 
    thoughts mild and gentle as your 
    dear eyes &#x26; gentle tone and voice
    but I.
