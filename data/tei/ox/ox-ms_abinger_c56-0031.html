    From this day natural philosophy and parti
    cularly chemistry became ^nearly my sole appli
    study. I read with ardour <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">m</del> those books
    so full of genius and discrimination
    <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">that have been written</del><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#c56-0031.01" class="link_ptr"/> on these sub-
    jects. I attended the lectures, and culti
    vated the acquaintance of the men
    of science of the university; and I found
    even in Mr Krempe a great deal
    of sound sense &amp; real information
    combined it is true with a repulsive
    phisiognomy &amp; manners, but not on
    that account the less valuable.
    In M. Waldman I found a true friend.
    His gentleness was never tinged by <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">dg</del>
    dogmatism and his instructions were
    given with an air of frankness and
    good nature that banished every idea
    of <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">pedantl</del> pedantry. It was perhaps the
    amiable character of this man that
    enclined me more to the study of that
    branch of <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">science</del>^natural philosophy which he professed than an
      intrinsic
    love for the science itself. But this
    <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">was</del><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#c56-0031.02" class="link_ptr"/> only in the first steps towards the
      knowledge; <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">as</del>more fully I entered <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">more
        fully</del> into

    for its own sake. That application
    which at first had been a matter
    of ch duty ^&amp; resolution, now became so ardent
    and eager that the stars often
    dissapeared^<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="link_ptr" href="c56-0031.03"><span>c56-0031.03</span></a> while I was yet <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">labouring</del>engaged
