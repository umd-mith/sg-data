    <line>suddenly I reflected how dreadful the combat which I</line>
    <line>momentarily expected would be to my wife and earnest</line>
    <line>ly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her</line>
    <line>untill I had obtained some knowledge as to the</line>
    <line>situation of my enemy.</line>
    <milestone unit="tei:p"/>
    <line>She left me, and I continued sometime walking</line>
    <line>up and down the passages of the house and</line>
    <line>inspecting every corner that might afford a re</line>
    <line>treat tomy adversary. But Idiscovered no trace</line>
    <line>of him and was beginning to conjecture that some</line>
    <line>fortunate chance had intervened to prevent</line>
    <line>the executation of his menaces; when suddenly I heard</line>
    <line>a shrill and dreadful screamâ€”It came from the</line>
    <line>room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard</line>
    <line>it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms</line>
    <line>dropped, the motion of very muscle and fibre was</line>
    <line>suspended, I could feel the blood trickling in my veins</line>
    <line>and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state</line>
    <line>lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated</line>
