    I could mention innumberable instances
    which although slight marked the

    and want Felix carried with pleasure
    to his sister the first little whisk flower
    that peeked out from beneath the

    In the day I believe he worked sometimes
    for a neighbouring farmer, 
        <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">for</del>
        because
       he
    often went 
        <del xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">out</del>
        forth,
       and did not return
    until dinner, yet brought no wood
    with him: at other times he worked
    in the garden but as there was little
    to do in the frost season he often
    read to the old man and Agatha.
    This reading had puzzled me extremely
    at first — but by degrees I discovered
    that he uttered many of the same
    sounds when he read as when he talked,
    I conjectured therefore that he
    found on the paper signs for speech
    which he understood and I ardently longed
    to

        comprehend

    early
  
  
    
    outhouse
    where to his
    perpetual
    astonishment
    he found his
    store always
    replenished by
    an invisible
    hand
