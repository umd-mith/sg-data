    Frankenstein the particulars of his formation
    but on this point he was impenetrable. Are you
    mad, my friend, said he, or whither does your
    senseless curiosity lead you- Would you also
    create for yourself & the world a daemonical
    enemy or to what does your questions
    tend. Peace, peace; learn my miseries &
    do not seek to encrease your own.
    Frankenstein discovered that I detail
    ed or made notes concerning his history he
    asked to see them & himself corrected and augmented them
    in many places but principally in guv
    giving the life & spirit of the the conver
    satins he held with his enemies- Since
    you have made an account ^ said he I would
    not that a mutilated one should go down to
    posterity.
    THus have ten days passed away
    while I have listened to the strangest
    tale that ever imagination formed.
    My thoughts I every feeling of my soul
    & ha have been drunk up by the interrest
    I felt m for my guest ^ one I wished to soothe him
    yet could can I tell counsel so infinitely miserable.
    Whose mind continually dwelt on horrors
    so destitute of every hope of consolation to
    live? Oh no- the oly joy he could feel can now feel know
    was in will be when he composesg his shattered mind ^ feelings to
    peace & death- Yet one feeling he enjoys,
    one comfort, the sourse offspring of solitude
    & delirium- he tho believed that when 
    in dreams he saw holds converse with his friends, who consoled
    his miseries or instigated him excitement to his vengeance
