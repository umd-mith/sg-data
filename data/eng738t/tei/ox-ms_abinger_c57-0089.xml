    and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted 
    
    by man.  I have seen, he said, the most
    
    beautiful scenes of my own country. I
    
    have been on the lakes of Lucerne & Uri
    
    where the snowy mountains descend al	[5]
    
    most perpendicularly to the water
    
    casting black & impenetrable shades
    would cause
    which cast a gloomy & mournful
    ^
    appearance were it not for the	[10]
    
    most verdant islands that relieve
    
    the eye by their gay appearance.  I have
    
    seen this lake agitated by a tempest

    said to be heard amid the pauses
    
    of the night wind.  I have seen the 
    
    lovely mountains of la Valais & the	[25]
    
    pays de Vaud; But this country, Victor,
    
    pleases me more than all those wonders.
    
    The Mountains of Switzerland are
    
    more majestic & strange but there
    
    is a charm in the banks of this divine	[30]
    
    river that I never before saw equalled.
    
    Look at that castle which overhangs
    yon
    that precipiece; and that also on
    
    the island almost concealed among	[35]
    
    the foliage of those lovely trees–and now
