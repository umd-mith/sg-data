    and companion. But it is your hap
    piness I desire as well as my own felicity
    when I declare to you that our marriage
    would reader me eternally miserable
    unless it were the dictate of your own
    free choice. Even now I weep when I co think
    that borne down as you are by the
    cruellest misfortunes you may stifle
    by the word honor all hope of that 
    love & happiness which would alone
    conduce to your felicity restore you to yourself. I who have
    so disinterrested an affection for you
    may encrease your miseries tenfold
    by being an obstacle to your wishes
    Ah Victor be assured that your cou
    sin & play mate has too sincere
    a love for you not to be made
    wretched by this supposition. Be hap
    py my friend and if you obey me in 
    this one request be assured that
    nothing on earth will have the power
    to disturb &#x2038; interrupt my tranquillity.
    Do not let this letter disturb you.
    Do y not answer it tomorrow or the
    next day or not even untill you
    come if it will give you pain. My
    Uncle will send me news of your 
    health and if I see but one smile
    on your lips when we meet occa
    sioned by this letter or any other
    exertion of mine I shall need no 
    other happiness- Your affectionate friend
    Elizabeth Lavenza
