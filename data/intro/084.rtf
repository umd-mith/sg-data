(In this concentrated period of writing for seven days or more [for part of which PBS was in London], MWS continued her narrative by apparently writing Draft: Vol. II, Chs. 9-12 in Notebook B [this estimate of writing four chapters or thirty-four pages during these seven days is based on MWS averaging approximately five pages/day during the days she drafted Notebooks A and B: 7 x 5=35]. The separate references to "work" in four of these "write" entries suggest that "work" did not refer to the writing of \i Frankenstein. \i0 From 11 January through 18 March, it is unlikely that MWS drafted any more of her novel in Notebook B: Claire Clairmont gave birth to her daughter Allegra on 12 January; MWS on that day entered "4 days of idleness" into her Bath Journal; although "work" appears six times as an entry between 17 and23 January, there is no "write " entry; on 24 January, MWS celebrated her son William's first birthday; on 25 January, she determined to go up to London to join PBS, who had been obliged to stay there since 6 January because of the Chancery suit on the custody of his and Harriet's children lanthe and Charles; on 26 January, MWS went up to London, where she and PBS stayed with the William Godwins and the Leigh Hunts while the Chancery suit continued; by 22 February, their son William, Claire Clairmont, her daughter Allegra, and the nurse Elise joined them in London; MWS, PBS, and William on 27 February removed to Marlow, where they stayed with Peacock; PBS returned to London on 2 or 3 March, carrying MWS letters to Leigh and to Marianne Hunt; MWS herself returned to London on 10 March, returned to Marlow on 13 March, and then occupied their new Albion House in Marlow on 18 March\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 see MWS \i Journal, \i0 I, 153-166; see also MWS \i Letters, \i0 I, 26-36.

(The placement of "Write every day" in this entry suggests that MWS wrote for as many as twenty-three consecutive days from 18 March through 9 April, a period of time more than sufficient for her to draft the remaining eighty-two pages\super 17\nosupersub  of Chs. 13-18 in Notebook B: approximately sixteen writing days at the average of five pages per day would have sufficed. The "extra" seven days here might mean a number of things: that "Write every day" did not mean every consecutive day; that MWS did not begin to "Write every day" until some days after she occupied Albion House on 18 March; that MWS finished drafting her novel before 9 April and, therefore, that "Write every day" also covered some of the time that she used to "Correct" the Notebooks [see 10-17 April below]; that these concluding chapters took longer because they were drafted without the benefit of earlier rough drafts; or, finally, that MWS was actually drafting more than Chs. 13-18 into Notebook B at this time [that is, I may have overestimated the number of chapters she drafted during the periods 6-13 December 1816 and 3-10 January 1817\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 see those dates above].)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li19\fi0\ri7\sb259\sa0\sl-259\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 27 March 1817 PBS was denied the custody of his and Harriet's children (lanthe and Charles) by order of the Chancery Court\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 see Medwin, Appendix III: "Chancery Papers Relating to Shelley's Children by Harriett," pages 463-486.}\par }
