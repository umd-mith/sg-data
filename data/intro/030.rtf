Usually, the very slant of an extended marginal passage or of an interlinear correction made it fairly easy to identify the two hands. But in those cases where I had to conjecture about a letter or a word or two that did not have very distinguishing letters,1 would consult with Bruce Barker-Benfield in order to determine which hand was the more likely, represent the word in the transcription by means of that font, and then footnote the conjecture: e.g., a 60/40 % likelihood that the "she" on pages 182-183 (line 12) in this edition was MWS's meant that I employed the MWS interlinear font and that the footnote for line 12 read \i "?MWS \i0 she."

Sometimes MWS would trace over in pen PBS's penciled words (see, e.g., pages 62-65,292-293 in this edition).
