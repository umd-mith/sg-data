<p>I owe a great deal to many friends and colleagues who have sacrificed much in order to come to my often frenzied calls for assistance during the past two years. Unlike Victor Frankenstein, who put his unnamed monster&#8217;s pieces together without the help of anyone and suffered the inhumanity of it all&#8212;and even unlike Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, who had only Percy Bysshe Shelley to assist in the creation of her novel about the monster&#8212;I have had many assistants in the construction of my monster, and I have benefited from all these collaborations. The resulting <em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks are dedicated to the three individuals who sacrificed the most through the long hours it took me to piece this edition together out of its constituent parts; and the book is also offered as a tribute to the unnamed who made so much of my work possible.</p>
<p>My first debts are to Lord Abinger (who in 1993 kindly granted me permission to undertake this edition) and to Donald H. Reiman (who obtained this permission and invited me to edit The <em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks for his Garland series in &#8220;The Manuscripts of the Younger Romantics&#8221;). The fully articulated texts in this edition started out as a skeletal WordPerfect typescript of Mary Shelley&#8217;s words that my typist and friend Debbie S. Lyall made from the photographs of Lord Abinger&#8217;s manuscripts, a text that I corrected, positioned, canceled, interlineated, supplemented with the Percy Shelley passages, and then entered into columns of varying widths to replicate the manuscript. The technical expertise by which I constructed these pages was provided by two computer experts at the University of Delaware, Karen M. Kral and Rich Duggan, both of whom sacrificed great amounts of time to see me through my labors: Kral, a phone call away, made magic macros that enabled me, e.g., to move text effortlessly into columns (what were actually Tables in WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS); and Duggan, in the same building with me, suffered my frequent cries for help.</p>
<p>Only after my initial formatting of the type facsimile of The <em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks was I aware that there was room to print a literal transcript of the <em>1818</em> first edition down the right column of each type facsimile page so that, at a glance, the reader could see first what Mary Shelley wrote in 1816&#8211;17, then what she and Percy Shelley added and corrected, and then what was published a few months later on 1 January 1818. Different parts of the &#8220;body&#8221; of this edition, therefore, were developed in the very process of its creation, and I am indebted to Steven Olsen-Smith and Shanon Wilson, two Ph.D.&#160;students at the University of Delaware who volunteered their precious time to prepare a WordPerfect text of <em>1818</em> that could be incorporated into the edition and run in tandem, line by line, with the <em>1816&#8211;17</em> Draft and with the <em>1817</em> Fair Copy. That text was then checked for accuracy by my reading it aloud against the <em>1818</em> first edition in the University of Delaware Library, and I am indebted to Mary Ellen Bellanca, Charlene E. Bunnell, Debbie S. Lyall, Suzanne Potts, and Barbara A. Silverstein for all of their assistance in reading: they also assisted me when I checked the type facsimile for accuracy by reading it aloud against the high-resolution black-and-white photographs of the manuscripts; and Bunnell and Potts checked the final layout of the edition. For the quality of these photographs I am especially grateful to the Photographic Department of the Bodleian Library (for photographing the manuscripts) and to Debbie Handy from Garland Publishing: only after comparing Garland&#8217;s first set of 9 x 12 prints with the manuscripts in the Bodleian Library in January 1995 did I realize that their cropped edges and washed-out details meant that an entire new set of 8&#189; x 11 prints were needed, and Debbie Handy handled all aspects of that replacement.</p>
<p>The &#8220;sinews and muscles&#8221; of this edition have been strengthened by the assistance of many individuals, especially George Miller, Chair of the English Department at the University of Delaware, who endured looking at many configurations of my pages as I attempted to get them looking right. The staff of the University of Delaware Library were always accommodating, and I particularly wish to thank Susan Byrnteson (Director of Libraries), Timothy D. Murray and his excellent staff in Special Collections, and all of the staff of Interlibrary Loan who obtained for me early nineteenth-century newspapers in film as well as in bound volumes. Anna Lou Ashby of The Pierpont Morgan Library was very helpful to me on a number of occasions, as were Doucet Devin Fischer and Stephen Wagner of The Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley &amp; His Circle at the New York Public Library. Others who made large and small contributions include Dorothy A. Carroll, Pamela Clemit, Veronica M. Eid, Paula R. Feldman, Ren&#233;e Fisher, Nancy Moore Goslee, Hilda and John Hadland, William Hodges and the staff of Duke Humfrey&#8217;s Library at the Bodleian Library, Nicholas A. Joukovsky, David Ketterer, Margaret Kulis, Danielle McClellan, Anne K. Mellor, Jeanne Moskal, Hershel Parker, H&#233;l&#232;ne Dworzan Reiman, Darlene A. Reynolds, Linda H. Russell, William St.&#160;Clair, Wilma Slaight, Johanna M. Smith, Marion Kingston Stocking (as always), and Jeffery Vail.</p>
<p>Special mention must be made of thirteen professional colleagues who in June and July 1996 agreed to read antepenultimate versions of my Introduction and of my <em>Frankenstein</em> Chronology. All of them made valuable suggestions, corrections, and alterations, almost all of which were singular (not repeated by the other readers) and almost all of which I adopted. I have truly benefited from these &#8220;collaborators,&#8221; these generous scholars who have &#8220;labored with&#8221; and on behalf of me: Terry Belanger, Bruce Barker-Benfield, Betty T. Bennett (with whom I had collaborated on earlier books), Nora Crook, Stuart Curran, Doucet Devin Fischer, Neil Fraistat, Steven E. Jones, Jerome J. McGann, Mary A. Quinn, Donald H. Reiman, Peter S. Shillingsburg, and Emily W. Sunstein. It should come as no surprise that many of these generous people have also published very useful books and editions with Garland Publishing, Inc., which I wish to thank for the support they have given me in this enterprise. Specifically, I thank from the New York offices, Audrey Leung, Bruce Lyons, John Shea (who worked many long hours on my behalf), and my editor Elspeth Hart (who has seen many of these &#8220;Bodleian&#8221; volumes through the press). Those who have worked with Elspeth know how wonderful she is&#8212;her wit and wisdom, her patience and generosity are indeed incomparable.</p>
<p>One of my &#8220;collaborators&#8221; named above must be singled out: Nora Crook (the editor of another 1996 <em>Frankenstein)</em> and I exchanged volumes of information over the Atlantic by phone, fax, and e-mail between December 1995 and August 1996. Financial support for these transmissions came from the English Department of the University of Delaware. The English Department and Garland Publishing also underwrote many more phone calls between Delaware and the Bodleian Library in the period March-August 1996. For other financial support during my two <em>Frankenstein</em> years, I wish to thank the University of Delaware&#8217;s Office of the Vice Provost for Research, Office of International Programs, and College of Arts and Science&#8212;as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities. And for their support of scholarship in the English Romantics, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of Garland Publishing and of The Johns Hopkins University Press&#8212;a glance at the &#8220;Short Titles&#8221; will evidence how much both publishers have contributed to studies in the Shelleys and their Circle during the past twenty years.</p>
<p>My first and final debts are to my dedicatees. I have already named my editor Elspeth Hart, and I wish here to thank my wife Peggy for all of her support and patience during a very long gestation period: needless to say, I missed my delivery date by more than a few days or even a few months. We can only hope that this edition will go forth and prosper and make the sacrifices worthwhile.</p>
<p>I save the last two paragraphs to acknowledge my greatest debt to a gentleman, a scholar, and a librarian by the name of Bruce Barker-Benfield, a Senior Assistant Librarian in the Department of Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library, Oxford University (and a Shelley scholar who has for years overseen all of the manuscripts of the Shelleys and their Circle in Duke Humfrey&#8217;s Library). There is no part of this edition, from its title page (verso as well as recto) to its Appendices, that have not benefited from his direct advice and indirect influence. His greatest presence is evident in the description of &#8220;The Makeup of The <em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks&#8221; in my Introduction as well as in the preparation of the Quiring Charts and Beta-Radiographs: those who have edited Bodleian manuscripts in the Garland series know that Barker-Benfield always prepares for each editor a written and detailed analysis of the physical paper, including the watermarks, quires, glue residue, and other particulars by which a part of literary history can be reconstructed&#8212;and with this written analysis is given Barker-Benfield&#8217;s <em>carte blanche</em> to do with it what the editor wants, whether to appropriate or to rewrite his text. The overall effects of Barker-Benfield&#8217;s collaboration with me are also evident on every page: he suggested naming this edition &#8220;<em>1816&#8211;17</em>&#8221; by which it could be distinguished from and related to the &#8220;<em>1818</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>1831</em>&#8221; editions; his objection to an earlier form of the footnotes led to a new formula for designating notes about passages in the left margin; similarly, his questioning an earlier incarnation of the shadowed areas on repeated pages in this edition led to my much more efficient use of the right margin to explain the textual traumas that made the repetition necessary; he was consulted about every letter or word or phrase where it was difficult to distinguish the hands of the two Shelleys; and his common sense about the physical makeup of the notebooks and about the process of the two Shelleys writing therein enabled me to make many valuable deductions and, equally important, prevented me from making unwarranted conjectures that would have misled future scholarship. In short, his generous interest in the accuracy of future scholarship on Mary Shelley&#8217;s <em>Frankenstein</em> was an inspiration.</p>
<p>I had worked with Barker-Benfield before but for shorter and less intense periods of time. For this edition I spent a total of five weeks at the Bodleian (in January/February and in September 1995) checking my type facsimiles (initially prepared by means of the photographs) against the original manuscripts. After hours and days of solitary checking of words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, and chapters in The <em>Frankenstein</em> Notebooks, I would look forward to those special mornings at 9:00 a.m. when Barker-Benfield would collect the Notebooks from the cabinet in Duke Humfrey&#8217;s Library and we would hurry down the wooden steps, exit the Bodleian Library through a staff door, pass through the archway to the Clarendon Building, and walk up to Barker-Benfield&#8217;s private office. Working there on <em>Frankenstein</em> was all the more meaningful because Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley apparently visited the Clarendon Building in August/September 1815 during their excursion from Windsor to Oxford; moreover, even Victor Frankenstein and Henry Clerval visited the same building during their short stay in Oxford in April 17[96]. Here, in one building (which also housed a library when Mary and Percy and when Victor and Henry visited), the historical and the fictional pasts were intertwined. Here, by inspecting each leaf of the manuscript and by attending to torn edges, ink blots, pin holes, watermarks, and other minutiae, we reconstructed the disbound pages of Mary Shelley&#8217;s Notebooks and discovered the process by which she created her novel. Here, the library became a laboratory, and Mary Shelley&#8217;s <em>Frankenstein</em> once again came to life.</p>
