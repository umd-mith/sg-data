There is no part of this edition, from its title page (verso as well as recto) to its Appendices, that have not benefited from his direct advice and indirect influence. His greatest presence is evident in the description of "The Makeup of The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks" in my Introduction as well as in the preparation of the Quiring Charts and Beta-Radiographs: those who have edited Bodleian manuscripts in the Garland series know that Barker-Benfield always prepares for each editor a written and detailed analysis of the physical paper, including the watermarks, quires, glue residue, and other particulars by which a part of literary history can be reconstructed\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f1\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af1\loch\f0\cchs0 and with this written analysis is given Barker-Benfield's \i carte blanche \i0 to do with it what the editor wants, whether to appropriate or to rewrite his text. The overall effects of Barker-Benfield's collaboration with me are also evident on every page: he suggested naming this edition \i "1816-1\i0 7" by which it could be distinguished from and related to the \i\expndtw17 "1818"\expndtw0  \i0 and \i "1831\i0 " editions; his objection to an earlier form of the footnotes led to a new formula for designating notes about passages in the left margin; similarly, his questioning an earlier incarnation of the shadowed areas on repeated pages in this edition led to my much more efficient use of the right margin to explain the textual traumas that made the repetition necessary; he was consulted about every letter or word or phrase where it was difficult to distinguish the hands of the two Shelleys; and his common sense about the physical makeup of the notebooks and about the process of the two Shelleys writing therein enabled me to make many valuable deductions and, equally important, prevented me from making unwarranted conjectures that would have misled future scholarship. In short, his generous interest in the accuracy of future scholarship on Mary Shelley's \i Frankenstein \i0 was an inspiration.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li7\fi355\ri5\sb0\sa0\sl-259\slmult0 \f1\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f1\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 I had worked with Barker-Benfield before but for shorter and less intense periods of time. For this edition I spent a total of five weeks at the Bodleian \expndtw14 (in\expndtw0  January/February and in September 1995) checking my type facsimiles (initially prepared by means of the photographs) against the original manuscripts. After hours and days of solitary checking of words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, and chapters in The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks, I would look forward to those special mornings at 9:00 \scaps a.m. \scaps0 when Barker-Benfield would collect the Notebooks from the cabinet in Duke Humfrey's Library and we would hurry down the wooden steps, exit the Bodleian Library through a staff door, pass through the archway to the Clarendon Building, and walk up to Barker-Benfield's private office. Working there on \i Frankenstein \i0 was all the more meaningful because Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley apparently visited the Clarendon Building in August/September 1815 during their excursion from Windsor to Oxford; moreover, even Victor Frankenstein and Henry Clerval visited the same building during their short stay in Oxford in April 17[96]. Here, in one building (which also housed a library when Mary and Percy and when Victor and Henry visited), the historical and the fictional pasts were intertwined. Here, by inspecting each leaf of the manuscript and by attending to torn edges, ink blots, pin holes, watermarks, and other minutiae, we reconstructed the disbound pages of Mary Shelley's Notebooks and discovered the process by which she created her novel. Here, the library became a laboratory, and Mary Shelley's \i Frankenstein \i0 once again came to life.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qr\li0\fi0\ri0\sb245\sa0 \f1\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f1\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 Charles E.
