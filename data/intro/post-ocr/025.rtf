Less than four months later, the unmarried Mary Godwin together with Percy Bysshe Shelley, their three-months-old son William, and Claire Clairmont (unmarried but pregnant with the child of Lord Byron [178 8-1824], who had recently separated from his wife) journeyed to Geneva, Switzerland, where they joined Byron and his doctor John William Polidori (1795-1821) for that famous summer of 1816, a summer that has since been celebrated by these writers' own recollections, by biographies, by fiction, and by film.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li2\fi346\ri12\sb2\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f1\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f1\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 Among the many works conceived and/or written during that wet and stormy summer\super 2\nosupersub  were Byron's \i Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto the Third, \i0 his drama \i Manfred, \i0 and his Vampire "Fragment"; Percy Bysshe Shelley's poems "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty" and "Mont Blanc"; Polidori's tale \i The Vampyre \i0 and his novel \i Ernestus Berchtold; or, The Modern Oedipus \i0 (both published in 1819); and Mary Shelley's \i Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. \i0 She began that novel as Mary Godwin in June 1816 when she was eighteen years old, she finished it as Mary Shelley in April/May 1817 when she was nineteen (she had married Percy Bysshe Shelley on 30 December 1816 after his first wife committed suicide), and she published it anonymously on 1 January 1818 when she was twenty.
