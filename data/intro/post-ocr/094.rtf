Scott also remarked that "Frankenstein is a novel upon the same plan with [Godwin's] Saint Leon; it is said to be written by Mr Percy Bysshe Shelley, who, if we are rightly informed, is son-in-law to Mr Godwin; and it is inscribed to that ingenious author."

In between, the reviewer observed that \i Frankenstein \i0 bears "marks of considerable power . . . but this power is so abused and perverted, that we should almost prefer imbecility" and that "there are occasional symptoms of no common powers of mind, struggling through a mass of absurdity." \i (The British Critic \i0 announced \i Frankenstein \i0 as a work in press in [Pmiddle-late October] 1817 [see that date above] and listed it as published in January 1818.)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li24\fi362\ri0\sb5\sa0\sl-254\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 The Gentleman's Magazine \i0 88 (April 1818): 334-335, published a short review of \i Frankenstein \i0 as "the production of no ordinary Writer; and, though we are shocked at the idea of the event on which the fiction is founded, many parts of it are strikingly good, and the description of the scenery is excellent."
