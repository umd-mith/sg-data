MWS needed these extra pages in order to revise what was apparently Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [5], a chapter that she would have written not long after finishing a &quot;very long&quot; chapter on 5 December 1816, but the way the name of Safie changes from &quot;Maimouna&quot; to &quot;Amina&quot; to &quot;Safie&quot; in these reconstructed bifolia suggests that she did not make the changes until April 1817. All of these intersections between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are important because they offer the only manuscript link between the last extant page of Notebook A (Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 3, page 21) and the first extant page of Notebook B (Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [6], page 62). For the <i>1818 </i>text that now fills part of that gap, see pages 312-313 in this edition; for more information on these name changes, see &quot;Naming in the <i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks&quot; below; for a visual representation of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y,&quot; see Quiring Charts<sup>19</sup> below; for the labyrinthine path through &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y,&quot; see the likely sequence of MWS's revisions as outlined on transcription pages 317 and 319 in this edition and as evidenced in the photofacsimiles, transcriptions, and notes on pages 314-342</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Third Insert Slip (Dep c. 534/1, folio 18&mdash;from the &quot;Y&quot;` Insert):</b> This third insert was written on a slip of paper that was used to link the last page of light-blue paper in Notebook A (Dep. c. 534/1, folio 17 verso [page 65])<i> </i>and the first page of cream paper in Notebook B (Dep. c. 534/1, folio 19 recto [page 62]). The slip consists of the top part of one leaf (that is, a half-sheet) of laid paper (commercially cut at top and outside edges), of cream color, that measures 89-91 x 186-188 mm., yielding estimated sheet measurements of [height unknown] x 372-376 mm. The paper has no surviving watermark but is probably of British origin. The lower edge is roughly torn (below the completed text), but the inside edge is more neatly torn against a fold, at which (about 46 mm. from the top edge) is a hole that could well be a sewing hole (though other tears at the inside edge make it hard to be certain). The slip (while blank) may have been torn from another notebook, which may have been turned to because all the light-blue paper of Notebook A had been exhausted. The text follows directly from folio 17 verso (completing the word &quot;language&quot;) and concludes with a later and revised version of part of a sentence that had been written on the top two lines of folio 19 recto, which is the first surviving leaf of Notebook B.</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Quiring Charts for Draft Notebook A:</b> Additional information on the physical makeup of the original notebook is to be found in notes positioned at the bottom of transcription pages.</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000" class="c2"><i>Symbols in the Charts</i></font></p><p align="left"><font class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing leaf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><b>|</b>       Bifolium, still joined (or singleton and stub, still joined)</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000" class="c3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing leaf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>|</i>   <i>    </i>Bifolium, now separated, but former join confirmed from matches</font></p><p align="left"><font class="c2">   of the torn or cut edges</font></p><p align="center"><font color="#000000" class="c2"><b>First Insert</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dep. c. 477/1</font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Bodl.

If so, then her pagination suggests that 40 pages (20 leaves) are now lost from the beginning of her Draft, which would have preceded the first surviving pages 41/42 that formed the last leaf of its quire. These numbers would yield two quires at the start, one of ten leaves and one of twelve: the totally missing first quire may have had a one-leaf discrepancy caused by its links with the endleaf-structure or by the start of the text; the second quire survives with just its last leaf, pages 41/42. This reconstruction is supported by the number of words in <i>1818</i> that were eventually produced by the missing pages (see pages 2, 6, and 7 in this edition for the computations about Walton's introductory Letters and part of Draft: Vol. I., Ch. [1]). This reconstruction is also supported by evidence suggesting that MWS changed from foliating to paginating Notebook A (see &quot;Foliation and Pagination in Notebook A&quot; and note 16).</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
