\*The missing leaf from the end of this quire (which would have been
paginated 183/184) was apparently canceled and torn out in the course of
writing, since page 182 with canceled material and the present page
number "183 " was altered from "185". Owing to the strength of the
binder's glue on the outside of the quires, the stubs of the missing
leaf and even of its conjoint leaf, folio 69 (pages 153/154), are still
attached to the first recto of the following quire (Quire [V], folio 84
recto [page 183]). An extensive addition by PBS at the inner margin of
folio 70 recto (page 155) was damaged when the leaves were separated:
fractions of it appear on the stub of folio 83 verso (page 182), proving
that the leaves were separated after PBS had added his corrections.

\*\*The last surviving verso of this quire, the unpaginated blank at
folio 94 verso, contains wet offset ink blots suggesting that there was
some writing (not necessarily related to *Frankenstein*) on the
following but now missing leaf from this quire. The glue-marks on the
verso of the surviving stub of the lost 16th leaf (as still attached to
folio 84) suggest that it was a regular gathering, but there is no
further physical evidence to allow for additional reconstruction of the
last section(s) of Notebook B.
