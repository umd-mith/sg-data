The leaf measures 220-222 x 184-188 mm. (fold at 180-181 mm.), yielding an estimated bifolium-sheet size of 220-222 x 360-362 mm., and a minimum whole-sheet size of 360-362 x 440-444 mm. Technically, the leaf was made up into a notebook of quarto format, with the remaining half of the watermark running sideways at the fold. From the &quot;felt&quot; side, the watermark reads &quot;1814,&quot; below almost entirely cut-away capital letters, the first letter possibly a &quot;W&quot; from [?&quot;W TURNER &amp; SON&quot;]. There are no other recognizable examples of this paper in the Bodleian Shelley collections. Sewing holes at the fold prove that this leaf originally belonged to a commercially-supplied notebook that was slightly smaller than Notebook C2 but possibly quite similar to it in appearance. However, the possible evidence of sewing-tapes at three stations and of kettle stitches suggests that this notebook may have been a thicker volume with multiple quires.</p> <p>This insert leaf with PBS text (but paginated &quot;187&quot; by MWS&mdash;apparently after PBS had transcribed the text) was made necessary because PBS had run out of room in the 48-page Fair-Copy Notebook C2 and needed one more page to conclude the transcription of the novel. After PBS transcribed the text on to this insert leaf, it was immediately inserted into Notebook C2, as is evidenced by the wet offset ink blots from it on to the facing folio 29 verso, the last leaf of Notebook C2.<sup>28</sup> For more explanation on the positioning of this insert leaf, see the footnotes to transcription page 771 in this edition.</p> <p><b>Substitute Pages (Dep. c. 534/2<sub>,</sub> folio 31):</b> This two-page substitute was written on one leaf of British laid paper, cream (now yellowing), with outer edges commercially cut and the inside (left-hand) edge neatly torn and with very faint traces of horizontal commercial ruling in lines <i>c.</i> 12 mm. apart. The leaf measures 225-227 x 181-183 mm., yielding an estimated bifolium-sheet size of 225-227 x 362-366 mm., and a minimum whole-sheet size of 362-366 x 450-454 mm. Technically, the leaf was made up into a notebook of quarto format, with the remaining half of the watermark set sideways at the torn edge. From the &quot;felt&quot; side, the watermark is a posthorn in a crowned shield (top half only).</p> <p>This one leaf appears to have come from a commercially-supplied notebook (very similar to but slightly taller than Notebooks C1 and C2) that was almost identical to another notebook from which MWS used twelve leaves on 13 July 1817 for writing down PBS&#39;s dictated translation of Aeschylus&#39;s <i>Prometheus Bound</i>, lines 1-314 (Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. c. 5, folios 73-84, text identified as PBS&#39;s in Barker-Benfield, <i>Guitar</i>, pages 88-89). The almost identical source<sup>29</sup> suggests that MWS may have written her substitute text in the summer of 1817, a conjecture supported by other evidence (see &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; for 13 July and for 3 August 1817). The traces of regular sewing holes in both the one-leaf and the twelve-leaf samples indicate that both samples were torn from single-section notebooks of probably 24 leaves each, much like Notebooks C1 and C2. On the <i>Frankenstein</i> leaf there is also a cluster of later, irregular sewing holes (through one of which is a fragment of white thread) at the inner top corner. These holes, only roughly similar to the irregular sewing holes in other C2 leaves, were probably made when this single leaf was stitched to other now missing substitute pages. See &quot;Hypothetically Reconstructing the Fair Copy&quot; (as well as the footnotes on transcription page 777 in this edition) for evidence that MWS actually used eight leaves (fifteen pages) for her re-transcription of PBS&#39;s Fair Copy.</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
