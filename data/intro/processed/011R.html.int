Unlike Victor Frankenstein, who put his unnamed monster's pieces together without the help of anyone and suffered the inhumanity of it all&mdash;and even unlike Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, who had only Percy Bysshe Shelley to assist in the creation of her novel about the monster&mdash;I have had many assistants in the construction of my monster, and I have benefited from all these collaborations. The resulting </font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks are dedicated to the three individuals who sacrificed the most through the long hours it took me to piece this edition together out of its constituent parts; and the book is also offered as a tribute to the unnamed who made so much of my work possible.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">My first debts are to Lord Abinger (who in 1993 kindly granted me permission to undertake this edition) and to Donald H. Reiman (who obtained this permission and invited me to edit The </font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks for his Garland series in &quot;The Manuscripts of the Younger Romantics&quot;). The fully articulated texts in this edition started out as a skeletal WordPerfect typescript of Mary Shelley's words that my typist and friend Debbie S. Lyall made from the photographs of Lord Abinger's manuscripts, a text that I corrected, positioned, canceled, interlineated, supplemented with the Percy Shelley passages, and then entered into columns of varying widths to replicate the manuscript. The technical expertise by which I constructed these pages was provided by two computer experts at the University of Delaware, Karen M. Kral and Rich Duggan, both of whom sacrificed great amounts of time to see me through my labors: Kral, a phone call away, made magic macros that enabled me, e.g., to move text effortlessly into columns (what were actually Tables in WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS); and Duggan, in the same building with me, suffered my frequent cries for help.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">Only after my initial formatting of the type facsimile of The </font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks was I aware that there was room to print a literal transcript of the<i>1818 </i>first edition down the right column of each type facsimile page so that, at a glance, the reader could see first what Mary Shelley wrote in 1816-17, then what she and Percy Shelley added and corrected, and then what was published a few months later on 1 January 1818. Different parts of the &quot;body&quot; of this edition, therefore, were developed in the very process of its creation, and I am indebted to Steven Olsen-Smith and Shanon Wilson, two Ph.D. students at the University of Delaware who volunteered their precious time to prepare a WordPerfect text of<i> 1818 </i>that could be incorporated into the edition and run in tandem, line by line, with the <i>1816-17</i> Draft and with the <i>1817 </i>Fair Copy. That text was then checked for accuracy by my reading it aloud against the <i>1818 </i>first edition in the University of Delaware Library, and I am indebted to Mary Ellen Bellanca, Charlene E. Bunnell, Debbie S. Lyall, Suzanne Potts, and Barbara A. Silverstein for all of their assistance in reading: they also assisted me when I checked the type facsimile for accuracy by reading it aloud against the high-resolution black-and-white photographs of the manuscripts; and Bunnell and Potts checked the final layout of the edition. For the quality of these photographs I am especially grateful to</font></p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>xi</i></font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
