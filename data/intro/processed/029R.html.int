The Library's purpose in adding such foliation was not to dictate an order of leaves (the presence of insertions allows for several alternatives) but to enable a neutral mode of citation for each surviving piece of paper.</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Notes:</b> Notes that address the physical conditions of a manuscript page are positioned with all other textual notes at the bottom of each transcription page.</font></p><p align="center"><font color="#000000" class="c3"><b>Transcription Pages (rectos)</b></font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1">The recto pages contain not only the type facsimile of the manuscript text but also (line by line) a literal transcript of the <i>1818</i> text as well as a textual apparatus in the form of footnotes.</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Type Facsimile of the Manuscript:</b> This type facsimile of the manuscript text was initially prepared from the high-resolution black-and-white photographs, then checked twice (for a period of 4 weeks in January/February 1995 and then for another week in September 1995) against the original manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, and then read aloud against the photographs in an attempt to represent accurately the text of the original. The text of the type facsimile was formatted by WordPerfect 6.0 for DOS, using &quot;Tables&quot; to create 2 or 3 columns and using &quot;Styles&quot; to create different fonts by which to distinguish MWS's hand from that of PBS and to represent other peculiarities of the manuscript (for example, smear deletions and Bodleian foliation). At a glance, the reader should be able to determine just what words and suggestions PBS introduced into MWS's novel. These different fonts and other conventions used in the type facsimile are as follows:</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Cancel Lines:</b> There are three means by which cancelations are represented. Individual letters or words or phrases that then MWS and/or PBS canceled by horizontal lines are represented by the strikeover feature: e.g., word or word (in the latter case, the manuscript cancel line did not pass through all of the letters of the word).<sup>8</sup> Although I did not graphically attempt to distinguish MWS from PBS horizontal cancel lines, the surrounding words in most instances should make possible the identification of who canceled what words: e.g., PBS replacement words would indicate that he had just canceled the words to be replaced. Footnotes are occasionally used to identify whether a letter or word or phrase was canceled by either MWS or PBS.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">Longer cancelations are much easier to distinguish. Ink and other evidence prove that MWS always canceled with long vertical straight lines (represented by a graphics line feature in WordPerfect), whereas PBS always canceled longer sections of the manuscript with wavy lines (represented by wavy ink lines that have been drawn on the transcript page in an attempt to replicate the original manuscript.)</font><font color="#000000" class="c1"><sup>9</sup></font></p><p align="left"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Carets:</b> Although I did not graphically attempt to distinguish MWS from PBS carets, the hand used for the</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
