Pp. 139-[150]: cut together (from pp. 175-186)

Pp. 153-[172]: torn together

Pp. 175-186: cut together (from pp. 139-[150])

\*The cut-marks visible on those leaves (folios 12-13, 15-18) that were
once conjoint with the six missing leaves are of identical pattern to
those of which the other halves still survive; consequently, the missing
leaves (which have scarcely left stubs as such on their surviving
halves) were presumably once present and were lost at some time after
separation. That these pages were cut after MWS transcribed her draft
into the Fair-Copy Notebook is revealed by MWS's word "said" on folio 14
verso (page 130, line 6), where half of the loop of “d” is cut away; the
other half is on the originally conjoint leaf, folio 1 recto (page 99,
line 6, left edge)—see pages 646-647 and 702-703 in this edition.

\*\*More evidence for these leaves being divided after MWS finished the
fair copying is in writing that is divided across surviving pairs (e.g.,
at folios 19 recto/29 verso, 19 verso/29 recto, 20 recto/27 verso, and
20 verso/27 recto). The stub of the lost 17th leaf (pages [171/172])
survives at folio 21 (pages 153/154) and preserves a fragment of a final
loop from the now missing page [172]. See manuscript facsimiles for this
evidence. Not represented in the Quiring Chart is folio 31 (substitute
pages 185MWS/186MWS, which has as its watermark the top half of a
posthorn.
