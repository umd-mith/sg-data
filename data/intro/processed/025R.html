Less than four months later, the unmarried Mary Godwin together with Percy Bysshe Shelley, their three-months-old son William, and Claire Clairmont (unmarried but pregnant with the child of Lord Byron [1788 -1824], who had recently separated from his wife) journeyed to Geneva, Switzerland, where they joined Byron and his doctor John William Polidori (1795-1821) for that famous summer of 1816, a summer that has since been celebrated by these writers&#39; own recollections, by biographies, by fiction, and by film.</p> <p>Among the many works conceived and/or written during that wet and stormy summer<sup>2</sup> were Byron&#39;s <i>Childe Harold&#39;s Pilgrimage: Canto the Third</i>, his drama <i>Manfred</i>, and his Vampire &quot;Fragment&quot;; Percy Bysshe Shelley&#39;s poems &quot;Hymn to Intellectual Beauty&quot; and &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;; Polidori&#39;s tale <i>The Vampyre</i> and his novel <i>Ernestus Berchtold; or, The Modern Oedipus</i> (both published in 1819); and Mary Shelley&#39;s <i>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.</i> She began that novel as Mary Godwin in June 1816 when she was eighteen years old, she finished it as Mary Shelley in April/May 1817 when she was nineteen (she had married Percy Bysshe Shelley on 30 December 1816 after his first wife committed suicide), and she published it anonymously on 1 January 1818 when she was twenty. Now, exactly 180 years after she began writing <i>Frankenstein</i>, the publication of The <i>Frankenstein</i> Notebooks will provide a unique opportunity to study the creative process that went into the making of Mary Shelley&#39;s monster.</p> <p>Many of those who have previously studied <i>Frankenstein</i> will know that there are a number of &quot;texts&quot; of the novel, each with significant textual flaws: the three-volume <i>1818</i> first edition,<sup>3</sup> with its printing errors; the &quot;Thomas&quot; copy of <i>1818</i>, with Mary Shelley&#39;s own holograph corrections and additions; the two-volume <i>1823</i> second edition (which used <i>1818</i> as setting copy), with at least 120 variant words occasioned by William Godwin, who had arranged publication of this edition while Mary Shelley (widowed since Percy&#39;s death on 8 July 1822) was still in Italy; and the one-volume <i>1831</i> revised edition (which used <i>1823</i> as setting copy), with its many changes that Mary Shelley herself introduced into the text. I say Mary Shelley herself and will from this point denominate her as MWS (as she herself did) thereby providing a shorthand to distinguish MWS from her husband PBS, who also had a considerable &quot;hand&quot; in the earlier <i>1818</i> text.</p> <p>This edition of The <i>Frankenstein</i> Notebooks will introduce yet more &quot;texts&quot; of the novel, not all of which are extant: the now lost original 1816 ur-text or &quot;story&quot; that MWS wrote in the summer of 1816; the two-volume <i>1816-1</i>7 &quot;book&quot; or manuscript Draft that MWS wrote for approximately nine months from <i>c.</i> August 1816 through 17 April 1817, during which time PBS made and suggested alterations to the manuscript; and the three-volume <i>1817</i> manuscript Fair Copy (transcribed directly from the Draft) that MWS (with some</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>xxv</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
