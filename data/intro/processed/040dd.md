\*For information on the source of the paper for Insert "X" and Insert
"Y" and on the ways they intersect in relation to each other and to the
main sequence of the narrative, see "Second Insert Pages" above as well
as transcription pages 317 and 319 in this edition. Suffice it to say
here that the original sequence of pages between page 21 of Notebook A
and page 62 of Notebook B is now missing and that these two Inserts were
most likely an extended rewrite of the lost text that was once contained
on page 57, line 1, through to page 62, line 2, of the Draft text that
is now missing.
