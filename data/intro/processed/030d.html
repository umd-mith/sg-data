MWS used the caret more often than PBS to signal an insertion: PBS would frequently write above a canceled word without employing a caret, but in some of these cases MWS may have later supplied a caret. For purposes of lineation in the type facsimile, the caret (positioned in order to replicate the manuscript) is considered a part of the line below which it appears.</p> <p><b>Conjectural Readings:</b> Curly brackets enclose words or letters in the manuscript that are conjectural or indecipherable: e.g., {?word} or {?}. Angle brackets enclose words or letters that have been cut or torn from the manuscript but may be conjectured or otherwise deduced: e.g., &lt;?word&gt; or &lt;word&gt;.</p> <p><b>Fonts:</b> I have employed the following fonts in this type facsimile of the manuscript:</p> <p>10-point CG Times for MWS text (8.5-point CG Times for MWS interlinear text)</p> <p><i>10-point Garamond Halbfett Kursiv for PBS text</i><i> (</i><i>8.5-point Garamond Halbfett Kursiv for interlinear PBS text</i>)<sup>10</sup><i><sup> </sup></i></p> <p>outline for smear deletions in either MWS text or <i>PBS text</i> (see, e.g., transcription pages 233 and 455) Courier-WP (Type 1) for all other hands (e.g., compositors or Bodleian staff)</p> <p>Although there are many similarities between MWS&#39;s and PBS&#39;s hands, there are enough differences (especially in their formation of the letters &quot;d,&quot; &quot;f,&quot; &quot;r,&quot; &quot;w,&quot;<sup>11</sup> and &quot;x&quot;) to make me confident that in almost all cases I have properly distinguished their hands. Usually, the very slant of an extended marginal passage or of an interlinear correction made it fairly easy to identify the two hands. But in those cases where I had to conjecture about a letter or a word or two that did not have very distinguishing letters, I would consult with Bruce Barker-Benfield in order to determine which hand was the more likely, represent the word in the transcription by means of that font, and then footnote the conjecture: e.g., a 60/40 % likelihood that the &quot;she&quot; on pages 182-183 (line 12) in this edition was MWS&#39;s meant that I employed the MWS interlinear font and that the footnote for line 12 read &quot;<i>?MWS</i> she.&quot; In those cases where neither ink nor other evidence would make one hand more likely than the other, the default was always to print the word as MWS&#39;s and to footnote the representation as conjectural.</p> <p><b>Incompletely Formed Terminal Letters:</b> In cases where MWS (or PBS) trailed off and did not quite finish the last letter of a word that was purposely left incomplete or canceled, I have taken the liberty to conjecture and print that letter as if it were completely formed in the manuscript (see, e.g., pages 72-73 in this edition, line 31, where there is enough of an incomplete &quot;u&quot; in the canceled word in manuscript to warrant my transcription of &quot;recou recourse&quot;&mdash;in this case, MWS apparently trailed off because she was unsatisfied by the slightly misformed &quot;re&quot; in her first attempt).</p> <p><b>Ink/Pencil:</b> All of the manuscript pages were written in ink, and each of the few places where MWS, PBS, or an unidentified hand used pencil is indicated in the footnotes. Sometimes MWS would trace over in pen PBS&#39;s penciled words (see, e.g., pages 62-65,292-293 in this edition). It was probably MWS who penciled the ruled margin in Notebook A (see &quot;Rules,&quot; below), and the Bodleian foliation was done in pencil.</p> <p><b>Line Numbers:</b> Bracketed line numbers [set in 8-point CG Times] respect all lines and interlineations except for below-the-line carets.</p> <p><b>Other Conventions:</b> I have attempted to reproduce the peculiarities of the manuscript as far as WordPerfect would allow&mdash;see, e.g., page 335 for writing up a slope (using the &quot;Advance&quot; command) and page 601 for writing vertically down a page (using Graphic Boxes).</p> <p><b>Overlaying Letters and Words:</b> In an attempt to make this type facsimile an easily read text, I have not employed the convention of arrows or carets in the transcription to indicate that one letter or word overlays another. Rather, I have printed the overlaying letters or words in the facsimile and relegated to the footnotes the letters and words underneath that were replaced. (The presence of the manuscript photofacsimile as a gloss and a check makes such a convention possible.) Thus the reader will frequently</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
