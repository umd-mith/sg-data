*Short Titles*

The first group of short titles below provide a convenient shorthand by
which to distinguish various texts and editions of *Frankenstein* from
each other, and all of the titles survey the scholarship that has
contributed to this edition. For many other important books and articles
on Mary Shelley, *Frankenstein*, and her other works, consult the
bibliographies published separately (e.g., Lyles), annually (e.g., in
the *Keats-Shelley Journal)*, or electronically (e.g., the MLA
International Bibliography on CD-ROM). For reviews of *Frankenstein*
published between 1818 and 1832, see "*Frankenstein* Chronology" below.

                    Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. Both the original and the reprint
                    have an appendix in which Butler prints "The Third Edition (1831):
                    Substantive Changes" together with "Collation of the Texts of 1818 and
                    1831."]

                    Crook, with an Introduction by Betty T. Bennett.) London: William
                    Pickering, 1996. [Crook provides four valuable textual notes: "Endnotes:
                    Textual Variants" (pages 182-227), in which she prints MWS's autograph
                    corrections in *1818 Thomas* and the substantive variants in *1823* and
                    *1831*; "A Note on Spelling Variants in *1818*,*1823* and *1831*" (page
                    228); "Unauthorized Variants" (page The *Frankenstein* Notebooks
                    229), in which she indicates that *1831 Joseph* introduced six textual
                    errors and that then *1818 Macdonald* incorrectly listed these six
                    errors as *1831* variants of the *1818* text; and "Silent Corrections"
                    (pages 230-231).]

                    that Hunter reprints are: "The Composition of *Frankenstein*" from
                    *1831* *Joseph;* Mellor, "Text"; PBS's 1832 *Athenæum* review of
                    *Frankenstein;* and partial texts of the 1818 reviews in *Quarterly

                    Magazine*—and of the 1824 review in *Knight*'*s Quarterly*.]


*1818 Macdonald*    Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus
                    (The 1818 version).* Ed. D. L. Macdonald & Kathleen Scherf. (Broadview
                    Literary Texts.) Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press, 1994. [Among
                    the other texts that Macdonald and Scherf reprint are: passages from the
                    works by Volney, Goethe, Plutarch, and Milton that the monster read; and
                    partial texts of the 1818 reviews of *Frankenstein* in *Blackwood's

                    page 34; and "unauthorized variants" in this appendix (apparently
                    traceable to errors in *1831 Joseph)* are listed in *1818 Crook*, page
                    229.]

*1818 Moser*        Mary Shelley. *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. The 1818 Text in
                    three volumes.* Illustrated by Barry Moser and with essays by Ruth
                    Mortimer, Emily Sunstein, Joyce Carol Oates, and William St. Clair. West
                    Hatfield: Pennyroyal, 1983. [Reprinted in paper, but without the
                    Mortimer, Sunstein, and St. Clair essays, Berkeley: University of
                    California Press, 1984.]

*1818 Rieger*       Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. *Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus: The
                    1818 Text (with variant readings, an Introduction, and Notes).* Ed.
                    James Rieger. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press (Phoenix
                    Edition), 1982. [This important edition (initially published in the
                    Library of Literature, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1974)
                    was the first to print a "Collation of the Texts of 1818 and 1831" and
                    the first to record the autograph variants in *1818 Thomas* (which
                    Rieger incorporated into the *1818* text). The 1974 edition was first
                    reprinted (with different pagination and lineation) by New York: Pocket
                    Books, 1976. The 1982 Chicago reprint, however, is to be preferred
                    because it corrects "minor errors in the introduction and apparatus" and
                    lists "some additional 1818/1831 variants at the end of the volume"—the
                    "Collation" is printed on pages 230-259 and (288).]

*1818 Thomas*       The copy of the first edition of *1818* (Pierpont Morgan Library, PML
                    16799) that MWS corrected, annotated, and presented to Mrs. Thomas in
                    Genoa in [?July] 1823.

*1818* *Wolf-1*     *The Annotated Frankenstein.* (*Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley;
                    Introduction and Notes by Leonard Wolf.) With Maps, Drawings, and
                    Photographs. New York: Clarkson N. Potter, Inc./Publishers, 1977. [This
                    edition prints a photofacsimiie of *1818*, but the copy chosen for
                    microfilming (together with a flawed photo-offset
                    process) led to a number of errors in the text, most resulting from
                    severe cropping when the pages were rearranged. For the fourteen places
                    where *1818 Wolf-1* misrepresents the *1818* text and/or introduces new
                    errors, see the footnotes on transcription pages 2, 79, 105, 163, 253,
                    449, 479, 519, 587 (and 715), 653 (and 757) in *1816-17 Robinson*.]

*1818 Wolf-2*       *The Essential Frankenstein.* Written and Edited by Leonard Wolf.
                    Including the Complete Novel by Mary Shelley. New York: Penguin Books
                    USA Inc. (A Plume Book), 1993. [This edition, a resetting of the text of
                    the *1818* photofacsimile in *1818 Wolf-1*, also carries over the errors
                    from that earlier edition.]

*1823*              Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. *Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus.*
                    A New Edition. 2 vols. London: G. and W. B. Whittaker, 1823. [A
                    photofacsimile of this edition was published by Oxford: Woodstock Books,
                    1993.]

[*1826*]            [Most likely a Henry Colburn re-issue of remaining copies of *1823*
                    without even a new title page.]

                    title page is preceded by an engraved title page: Mary W. Shelley.
                    *Frankenstein.* London: Colburn and Bentley, 1831. A photofacsimile of
                    this engraved title page may be seen in *1818 Crook*, page 173.]

*1831 Hindle*       Mary Shelley. *Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus.* Ed. Maurice
                    Hindle. London: Penguin Books, 1992. [This hybrid edition, an expansion
                    of Hindle's Penguin edition of 1985, prints *1831* but divides it by
                    means of the volumes and chapters of *1818*; it also includes "Appendix
                    A: Select Collation of the Texts of 1831 and 1818," in which Hindle also
                    prints "a selection of significant revisions made by Percy Shelley at MS
                    stage, which Mary Shelley adopted," but the reader is reminded that not
                    all of Hindle's identifications of PBS's hand are correct.]

*1831 Joseph*       Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. *Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus.*

                    1980. Joseph in an appendix was one of the first to address "The
                    Composition of*Frankenstein*." See *1818 Crook* above for Joseph
