Even within the text of the novel (which so often reflects what happens outside the text), Victor actually corrected Walton's narratives about Victor and the monster and the De Laceys (see pages 606-607 in this edition); consequently, we are reading Victor writing as if he were Walton writing about Victor. Victor himself, then, was a collaborator and an editor: he &quot;corrected and augmented&quot; Walton's text because he &quot;would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity&quot;&mdash;an ideal that any writer or editor hopes to serve!</font><font color="#000000" class="c1"><sup>52</sup></font></p><p align="left"><font class="c1">Notes</font></p><ol type="1" start="1" class="c3"><li align="justified"><font class="c2">Called Claire throughout this edition, Clara Mary Jane Clairmont was also sometimes called &quot;Jane&quot; by her family, which also included her half-brother Charles Gaulis Clairmont (1795-1850) and her step-sister Fanny Imlay Godwin (1794-1816). Claire and Charles were children of Mary Jane Vial Clairmont (1768-1841), who brought the two children into the family after she married the widower William Godwin in 1801. Filling out Godwin's family was William Godwin, Jr. (1803-1832).
