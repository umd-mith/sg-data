A quick visual comparison of these parallel texts will show the places of major alteration between the Draft and <i>1818</i>:<i> </i>see especially pages 449 and 459 in this edition for places where MWS and/or PBS made extensive changes late in the proof stage; see also the &quot;<i>Frankenstein </i>Chronology&quot; for 20 October, for [22] October, and for 28 October 1817.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">Where no manuscript is extant, the </font><font color="#000000" class="c1"><i>1818 </i>text is still reproduced diplomatically but without reference to any manuscript. By including these portions of <i>1818</i>, the reader can both &quot;see&quot; the proportion of text missing from manuscript and have at hand a complete <i>1818 </i>text to compare with other texts.</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Page Numbers:</b> The page numbers in <i>1818 </i>are in bold, bracketed and placed in the literal transcript to show the <b>[number:]</b>beginning of a page, even if the page breaks over a hyphenated word (see, e.g., transcription page 17 in this edition).</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Dagger:</b> A † follows any word, number, or punctuation mark in the literal transcript of <i>1818</i> that is glossed in the footnotes, the note being preceded by &quot;<b><u>1818</u> text:line number</b>]&quot;.</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Paragraph Symbol:</b> A <i>¶ </i>is added in the transcript of <i>1818 </i>to make more evident the beginning of each paragraph (excepting the first paragraph in each chapter that is signaled by a display word).</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Double Quotation Marks:</b> The ordinary double quotation marks in CG Times (&quot; &quot;) are altered in the literal transcript to curved quotation marks (“ ”) in an attempt to replicate those in <i>1818.</i></font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Headers:</b> The headers for each page locate the reader in the manuscript text (whether <i>1816-17 </i>Draft or <i>1817 </i>Fair Copy) and in the <i>1818 </i>text. More important, the headers enable the reader to witness the restructuring of a two-volume novel in Draft (through a three-volume novel in Fair Copy, most of which has to be extrapolated from the other evidence) into a three-volume first edition in <i>1818. </i>In the act of fair copying her text, MWS actually changed the beginning and endings of many chapters as she restructured her novel. That restructuring is made evident in the headers for each transcription page: see, for example, transcription page 69<i> </i>where the beginning of <b>Draft: Vol. I, Ch. 5, page 61</b> has become the beginning of <b>1818: Vol. I, Ch. III, pages 78-79</b>; or transcription page 473 where <b>Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 12, page 118</b> has been divided into <b>1818: Volume III, Chs. II-III, pages 38-40</b>. In this latter example, MWS's manuscript note to herself to &quot;Finish Chap. 2 here&quot; directly shows how she restructured the two-volume Draft into the three-volume Fair Copy. The reader should also note how nearly identical the pagination is between the three-volume Fair Copy and the three-volume <i>1818: </i>see, e.g., the header on transcription page 749 in this edition: <b>Fair Copy: Vol. III, Ch. VII, page 175 [=] 1818: Vol. III, Ch. VII, pages 176-178</b>.</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Notes:</b> The format and the extent of the notes are in part determined by the limitation of space, but footnotes rather than endnotes are used in order to make all relevant information available on facing pages of this edition. I have attempted to serve simultaneously, as much as possible, the principles of clarity, economy, and consistency. The different fonts used for MWS and PBS in the type facsimile of the manuscript mean that I did not have to footnote each place PBS wrote in the manuscript, but I do identify as PBS's any of his words or passages that are discussed in the notes (e.g., &quot;<i>PBS </i>ing <i>overlays MWS </i>ed <i>in </i>examining&quot;).</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>MWS and PBS in Notes</b>: Unless identified as PBS's (or someone else's), all words or marks discussed in the footnotes are MWS's. Words conjecturally printed as MWS's in the type facsimile are footnoted with &quot;?MWS&quot;; those conjecturally printed as PBS's are footnoted with &quot;?PBS.&quot;</font></p><p align="justified"><font color="#000000" class="c1"><b>Order of Notes:</b> Each note, preceded by location (whether page position or line number) and a closing bracket (both set in bold) is arranged in the following order: <b>preceding page(s)]; entire page]; left edge]; top of page]; right edge]; bottom of page]; margin:sequential line number(s) from type facsimile]; sequential line number(s) from type facsimile]; <u>1818</u> text: sequential line number(s) from type facsimile]; following page(s)]</b>.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
