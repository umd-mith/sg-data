[1] (see above for explanation).</p> <p><b>[?early January 1817]:</b> &quot;Clairval&quot; was the name in Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 10, original page 100, but &quot;Clerval&quot; was the name later in this chapter on original pages 101-103. This apparently incorrect or at least inconsistent &quot;Clairval&quot; was not separately corrected to &quot;Clerval&quot; (see below for the nineteen places where MWS did alter &quot;Clairval&quot; to &quot;Clerval&quot;), but the passage in which &quot;Clairval&quot; appeared was canceled by MWS between 18 April and 10/13 May 1817 (see pages 416-427 in this edition for the dating of the cancelations), making the separate alteration unnecessary. When an unpaginated insert was added to Ch. 10 in April/May 1817, &quot;Clerval&quot; was used (see transcription page 435 in this edition).</p> <p><b>[?early January 1817] and [?18 March-9 April 1817]:</b> The one use of &quot;Clairval&quot; in Ch. 10 (possibly a mistake occasioned by MWS often writing out the names &quot;Claire&quot; and &quot;Clairmont&quot; in letters) may have prompted MWS to change the spelling of the name, for the next nineteen instances of the name in Draft: Vol. II, Chs. 11-17, were &quot;Clairval,&quot; each of which was altered to &quot;Clerval&quot; at a later time, most likely in April/May 1817 at one sitting when MWS was fair copying her novel. The first &quot;ai&quot; that is canceled and replaced by &quot;e&quot; is in Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 11 [renumbered &quot;2&quot; for the three-volume sequence], page 108 (see pages 452-453 in this edition): the dark ink on the renumbered chapter &quot;2&quot; seems to be the same as that used for the alterations of &quot;Clairval&quot; to &quot;Clerval.&quot;</p> <p><b>[?early April 1817]:</b> By this time, MWS had decided on &quot;Clerval&quot; as evidenced by the six instances of that spelling in Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 18, and by the four instances of that spelling in the extant Fair Copy.</p> <p><b>[?April/May 1817]:</b> MWS altered the nineteen instances of &quot;Clairval&quot; to &quot;Clerval,&quot; most likely during the time she was fair copying her novel.</p> <p>Safie most likely was not in the ur-text, and when she was introduced into that &quot;very long&quot; Chapter 4 that MWS wrote in late November/early December (she finished it by 5 December&mdash;see &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; as well as transcription pages 317 and 319 in this edition), she was apparently first called &quot;Maimouna,&quot; a name that may be traced to Robert Southey&#39;s Maimuna in <i>Thalaba</i>, a name that PBS used as a nickname for his friend Mrs. Boinville and that he used in his prose fragment &quot;The Assassins&quot; for Khaled&#39;s daughter (a precursor of Cythna in PBS&#39;s <i>Laon and Cythna</i>).<sup>35</sup> The evidence that Safie was first called &quot;Maimouna&quot; is to be found in Notebook B as well as in the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; rewrite inserts that MWS used to help join Notebooks A and B in April 1817. When MWS started to rewrite this section of her novel on the yet remaining paper from Notebook A (and we lack any manuscript evidence for earlier sections of the Safie episode), she first changed the already denominated &quot;Maimouna&quot; to &quot;Amina&quot; and used that name four times on Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [5], page 59 and page 60 [&quot;X&quot; insert] but then mistakenly reverted to &quot;Maimouna&quot; (only to change it to &quot;Amina&quot;) one more time on page 60. MWS then decided to rewrite this &quot;X&quot; insert with a &quot;Y&quot; insert by which time she had decided on the name &quot;Safie,&quot; a name that MWS apparently did not use in her novel prior to April 1817.<sup>36</sup> She continued her narrative about the newly named &quot;Safie&quot; up through half of Draft: Ch. [5], page 59+64 [&quot;Y&quot; insert] and then doubled back to use already existing text in &quot;X&quot; where she replaced the short-lived &quot;Amina&quot; with &quot;girl&quot; in one place (on page 59) and with the new name of &quot;Safie&quot; three times (twice on page 59 and once on page 60). Pen and ink evidence suggest that MWS had stopped writing on the &quot;X&quot; pages at line 25; having reached that point by doubling back, she then began again to write her revised narrative at lines 25 and 26 of Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [5], page 60 [&quot;X&quot; insert], from which point Safie was called only &quot;Safie.&quot; &quot;Safie&quot; continued to be the unemended name as MWS finished the rewrite on &quot;X&quot; and then returned to the &quot;Y&quot; insert and began again to rewrite her narrative at lines 13-14 in Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [5], page 59+64 [&quot;Y&quot; insert]. (Those not wishing to follow all these intricacies are invited merely to follow the narrative in the sequence I have outlined by reading the unshadowed sections in pages 317-341 in this edition.) That all of these changes from the original &quot;Maimouna&quot; to the short-lived and intermediating &quot;Amina&quot; to the final &quot;Safie&quot; were made in April 1817 (after MWS had finished all or most of her Draft) is indicated by the fact that MWS continued to use the original &quot;Maimouna&quot; in the remaining chapters of Notebook B: see transcription pages 353, 359,</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
