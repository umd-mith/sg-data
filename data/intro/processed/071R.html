Even within the text of the novel (which so often reflects what happens outside the text), Victor actually corrected Walton&#39;s narratives about Victor and the monster and the De Laceys (see pages 606-607 in this edition); consequently, we are reading Victor writing as if he were Walton writing about Victor. Victor himself, then, was a collaborator and an editor: he &quot;corrected and augmented&quot; Walton&#39;s text because he &quot;would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity&quot;&mdash;an ideal that any writer or editor hopes to serve!<sup>52</sup></p> <p>Notes</p> <ol> <li> Called Claire throughout this edition, Clara Mary Jane Clairmont was also sometimes called &quot;Jane&quot; by her family, which also included her half-brother Charles Gaulis Clairmont (1795-1850) and her step-sister Fanny Imlay Godwin (1794-1816). Claire and Charles were children of Mary Jane Vial Clairmont (1768-1841), who brought the two children into the family after she married the widower William Godwin in 1801. Filling out Godwin&#39;s family was William Godwin, Jr. (1803-1832). See <i>Clairmont Correspondence</i>, I, xviii, for the succinct statement on these relationships and for the remark that &quot;Of these five children, born within nine years of each other, no two, apparently, had two parents in common.&quot; </li> <li>The summer of 1816 was the coldest and wettest on record for many places in England, Europe, and the United States; for information on the strange weather (occasioned in part by atmospheric dust from volcanic eruptions during preceding years), consult Clubbe, &quot;Summer,&quot; pages 26-40.</li> <li>See &quot;Short Titles&quot; for a complete list of abbreviated forms used in citations: <i>1818</i>,<i> 1823</i>, and <i>1831</i> distinguish the three major editions of <i>Frankenstein</i> in MWS&#39;s lifetime; <i>1818 Thomas</i> indicates the copy of <i>1818</i> in which MWS made holograph alterations; and titles like <i>1818 Rieger</i> and <i>1818 Crook</i> distinguish scholarly editions of <i>1818</i> by the name of the editors. In order to continue the efficiency of this shorthand, I propose that <i>1816-17</i> denominate the Draft; <i>1817</i>, the Fair Copy; and <i>1816-17 Robinson</i>, this edition.</li> <li>As MWS expanded her &quot;story&quot; into the Draft novel, she may have drafted some new sections of her novel in now lost manuscripts that intervened between the ur-text and Draft Notebooks A and B.</li> <li>I repeat this list of collators in the &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; below for 31 October 1831. Murray, &quot;Changes,&quot; pages 320-323, lists 114 substantive textual variants between <i>1818</i> and <i>1823</i>; and <i>1818 Crook</i> adds 9 more (see page xcvi).</li> <li>See Walton&#39;s record of Victor&#39;s remarks in the revised Letter IV: &quot;&#39;I agree with you,&#39; replied the stranger; &#39;we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves&mdash;such a friend ought to be&mdash;do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend [Clerval], the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship&#39;&quot; (<i>1831</i>, page 16).</li> <li>The three names of &quot;photofacsimile,&quot; &quot;type facsimile,&quot; and &quot;literal transcript&quot; are adopted and adapted from Greetham, page 350.</li> <li>In less than six places, I have used the &quot;character&quot; feature and superimposed a slash (/) over a letter when the original manuscript cancelation and the circumstances of the representation made such a different convention desirable&mdash;see, e.g., page 665, lines 13 and 14, in this edition.</li> <li>This difference has never before been identified and may help other editors to distinguish canceling hands in other MWS and PBS manuscripts.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol> <li>In those cases when PBS used pencil, I have suggested the medium by using Garamond Kursiv rather than Garamond Halbfett Kursiv (see, e.g., transcription page 291 for &quot;This chapter is too short&quot; and page 301 for &quot;o you pretty Pecksie!&quot;).</li> <li>The &quot;w&quot;s in MWS&#39;s and PBS&#39;s hands were usually judged to be nearly identical, but on closer inspection it is clear that the middle section of an MWS &quot;w&quot; (the inverted &quot;v&quot;) is lower than that of a PBS &quot;w,&quot; where the middle ascender rises nearly to the plane made at the top of the &quot;w.&quot;</li> <li>I physically inspected twelve of these fifteen copies&mdash;information about those in Cambridge University Library, the Newberry Library, and the Beinecke Library was provided to me by letter, fax, and telephone.
