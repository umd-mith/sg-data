[1]; for the end of Draft: Vol. II, Ch. 3; and for all of Draft: Vol. II, Ch. [4]). The Fair Copy was originally written in [?eleven] smaller (soft-cover) notebooks, the only surviving ones here denominated Notebooks C1 and C2. These two notebooks are now disbound: 19 leaves are missing; the 29 surviving leaves (with text on 58 pages), together with 1 insert leaf (with text on 1 page) as well as 1 substitute leaf (with repeated text on 2 pages), contain approximately 12% of the received <i>1818</i> text.</p> <p>In an attempt to simplify the complicated sequence of these texts, I offer the following outline.</p> <p>The Texts of <i>Frankenstein</i></p> <p>(For more information on each of these texts [including the dating thereof], consult the &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; below.
