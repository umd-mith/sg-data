Less than four months later, the unmarried Mary Godwin together with Percy Bysshe Shelley, their three-months-old son William, and Claire Clairmont (unmarried but pregnant with the child of Lord Byron [1788 -1824], who had recently separated from his wife) journeyed to Geneva, Switzerland, where they joined Byron and his doctor John William Polidori (1795-1821) for that famous summer of 1816, a summer that has since been celebrated by these writers' own recollections, by biographies, by fiction, and by film.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">Among the many works conceived and/or written during that wet and stormy summer</font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><sup>2</sup> were Byron's <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto the Third</i>,<i> </i>his drama <i>Manfred</i>,<i> </i>and his Vampire &quot;Fragment&quot;; Percy Bysshe Shelley's poems &quot;Hymn to Intellectual Beauty&quot; and &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;; Polidori's tale <i>The Vampyre </i>and his novel <i>Ernestus Berchtold; or, The Modern Oedipus </i>(both published in 1819); and Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. </i>She began that novel as Mary Godwin in June 1816 when she was eighteen years old, she finished it as Mary Shelley in April/May 1817 when she was nineteen (she had married Percy Bysshe Shelley on 30 December 1816 after his first wife committed suicide), and she published it anonymously on 1 January 1818 when she was twenty. Now, exactly 180 years after she began writing <i>Frankenstein</i>,<i> </i>the publication of The <i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks will provide a unique opportunity to study the creative process that went into the making of Mary Shelley's monster.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">Many of those who have previously studied </font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Frankenstein </i>will know that there are a number of &quot;texts&quot; of the novel, each with significant textual flaws: the three-volume <i>1818 </i>first edition,<sup>3</sup> with its printing errors; the &quot;Thomas&quot; copy of <i>1818</i>,<i> </i>with Mary Shelley's own holograph corrections and additions; the two-volume <i>1823 </i>second edition (which used <i>1818</i> as<i> </i>setting copy), with at least 120 variant words occasioned by William Godwin, who had arranged publication of this edition while Mary Shelley (widowed since Percy's death on 8 July 1822) was still in Italy; and the one-volume <i>1831 </i>revised edition (which used <i>1823 </i>as setting copy), with its many changes that Mary Shelley herself introduced into the text. I say Mary Shelley herself and will from this point denominate her as MWS (as she herself did) thereby providing a shorthand to distinguish MWS from her husband PBS, who also had a considerable &quot;hand&quot; in the earlier <i>1818 </i>text.</font></p><p align="justified"><font class="c2">This edition of The </font><font color="#000000" class="c3"><i>Frankenstein </i>Notebooks will introduce yet more &quot;texts&quot; of the novel, not all of which are extant: the now lost original 1816 ur-text or &quot;story&quot; that MWS wrote in the summer of 1816; the two-volume <i>1816-1</i>7 &quot;book&quot; or manuscript Draft that MWS wrote for approximately nine months from <i>c. </i>August 1816 through 17 April 1817, during which time PBS made and suggested alterations to the manuscript; and the three-volume <i>1817 </i>manuscript Fair Copy (transcribed directly from the Draft) that MWS (with some</font></p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="justified">&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><font color="#000000" class="c3">xxv</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
