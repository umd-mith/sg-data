Nothing brings this truth home more than my facing the responsibility of naming the unnamed being created by Victor Frankenstein&mdash;should I denominate him &quot;being&quot; or &quot;creature&quot; or &quot;monster&quot; or any number of other cognomens (e.g., &quot;wretch&quot;), all names that are in the novel, although each is filtered through the consciousnesses of Walton, Victor, the &quot;monster&quot; himself, and the De Laceys?<sup>30</sup> MWS herself avoided giving him a name in the novel, and after she saw a dramatic production of <i>Frankenstein</i> in 1823 she approved the use of &quot;--------&quot; for the character played &quot;by M<sup>r</sup> T. Cooke: this nameless mode of naming the un{n}ameable is rather good&quot; (see &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; for 9 September 1823). My choice of name will undoubtedly dictate a response, and I am certain that some readers up to this point have been dissatisfied with my calling their &quot;creature&quot; a &quot;monster,&quot; a choice culturally conditioned, I am sure, by the movie incarnations of <i>Frankenstein</i>, but a choice in keeping with both MWS and PBS begging (or, more likely, posing) the question of the name, in keeping with what MWS said about the monster in her <i>1831</i> Introduction and elsewhere, and in keeping with my own personal reading of the novel.</p> <p>I have attempted to be as objective and factual as possible in editing this novel, and I do not intend to offer any extensive analysis at this point. However, I will indulge myself in a paragraph and acknowledge that I teach <i>Frankenstein</i> as a doppelg&auml;nger novel, one in which MWS used all of the major characters to reflect parts of Victor Frankenstein&#39;s psychological being. In some ways the novel ends the night that it originally began with the words &quot;It was on a dreary night of November.&quot; That is to say, Victor committed psychic suicide that night when he created the monster: his pursuit of knowledge caused him to destroy love, to &quot;procrastinate&quot; and to &quot;weaken&quot; his &quot;affections&quot;--in effect to deal his heart a mortal wound, the heart represented by Clerval (&quot;the image of [his] former self&quot;) and by Elizabeth (called the &quot;living spirit of love&quot; in <i>1831</i>, page 25; for the other quotations above, see transcription pages 91, 93, 97, and 453 in this edition). And the rest of the novel may be read as an externalization, a literalization of that psychic suicide: Victor in the form of the monster actually killed the better part of himself in the form of Clerval and Elizabeth. In other words, Victor the creature usurped the powers of a creator: he left his Eden of Geneva and family and fell from innocence to experience while eating of the tree of knowledge at Ingolstadt. In that fall Victor became psychologically disfigured, and the &quot;creature&quot; (who was initially born in the image of his creator) was destined (with the creative artist MWS controlling this &quot;destiny&quot;) to mirror his creator&#39;s fall from psychological wholeness and to die finally as a &quot;monster.&quot; I have merely chosen to denominate the unnamed with his last name rather than his first.</p> <p>Even MWS in her <i>1831</i> Introduction called the monster a &quot;hideous phantasm,&quot; a &quot;horrid thing,&quot; and a &quot;hideous progeny.&quot;<sup>31</sup> By these phrases, she seems to have avoided both &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;monster&quot;&mdash;and therefore probably intended to implicate the reader in name calling. I concede the point of many critics (and even PBS) who prefer to call this monster a &quot;being&quot; or a &quot;creature&quot; because his monstrosity was &quot;occasioned&quot; (and I choose that word with care) by Victor and by other circumstances&mdash;even PBS in his <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> review of the novel (see &quot;<i>Frankenstein</i> Chronology&quot; for 10 November 1832) referred most often to the &quot;Being&quot; and once to the &quot;tremendous creature&quot; whose only association with the &quot;monstrous&quot; was in the &quot;circumstances of his existence.&quot; Although PBS did not quite acquit the Being of his &quot;crimes and malevolence,&quot; he argued that they &quot;flow inevitably from certain causes fully adequate to their production. They are the children, as it were, of Necessity and Human Nature.&quot; What sounds a little bit like Heredity vs. Environment is really almost all the latter, because for PBS both &quot;Necessity&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; (apparently, the nature of other humans; if not that, then something akin to &quot;destiny&quot;) seem to assign more blame to others than to the Being. As PBS would have it, &quot;Treat a person ill, and he will become wicked.&quot; I can understand but cannot agree with PBS or with others who prefer to cast the blame primarily or exclusively on that which lies outside the individual. In short, I sympathize with the monster and prefer him to Victor, but I also judge that he is culpable for monstrous acts of murder and revenge&mdash;and PBS should have judged him by the same standard that he used in 1819 to judge Beatrice Cenci: &quot;Revenge, retaliation, atonement, are pernicious mistakes.&quot; Indeed, the PBS of 1819 would have been a better reviewer of the 1818 novel, and I here appropriate what PBS said about Beatrice Cenci: &quot;It is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification or [the</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
