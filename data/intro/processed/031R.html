The <i>single horizontal rule</i> is used to separate the footnotes from the type facsimile and the literal transcript above. The <i>double vertical rule</i> is used to separate the type facsimile from the literal transcript of <i>1818.</i> The <i>single vertical rule</i> represents the penciled rule that MWS made in Notebook A to create a left margin in which she and PBS could emend the text. I have attempted to represent the position of the words next to this rule as accurately as possible: I have right justified all of the words to the left of that rule (except for the last line of a passage if it is some distance from the rule [see, e.g., transcription page 11, lines 19-41 in the margin, the &quot;her own.&quot; in line 41 not right justified]); and, where warranted and possible, I have represented words that cross the marginal rule (see, e.g., transcription page 97, line 30 in the margin).</p> <p><b>Shadowing of Page:</b> Any partially shadowed transcription page indicates that the page is repeated elsewhere (with different shadowing) to accommodate and explain an insertion in the manuscript notebook: the reader is advised to follow the narrative through the unshadowed sections of these pages and to read about the circumstances of the insertion in the shadowed sections (the first instances of this repetition on pages 14-37 in this edition are somewhat complicated, involving more than one insertion at a time; the reader is therefore advised initially to consult simpler forms of this repetition, e.g., on pages 416-421 in this edition).</p> <p><b>Literal Transcript of <i>1818</i>:</b> The text of <i>1818 is</i> based on (and was read aloud against) the copy in the University of Delaware Library, and where there were printing errors it was checked against other copies; in one place, the word &quot;Then&quot; and an adjacent comma, both of which had dropped from the Delaware and some other copies of <i>1818</i>, were restored to the text (see transcription page 283 in this edition). In all, I have consulted fourteen additional copies of the <i>1818</i> first edition: four copies at the Pierpont Morgan Library (one of which is <i>1818 Thomas</i>), three copies at The Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at The New York Public Library, and one copy each at the Bodleian Library (Oxford University), All Souls College (Oxford University), Cambridge University Library, the Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, and the library of one private collector.<sup>12</sup> A selective comparison of printing errors in all fifteen copies suggests that there was only one stop-press correction in the 500 printed copies of the first edition (affecting only a page number), and that may have occurred very early in the pulling of revises (see line 21 and note on transcription page 257 in this edition). There are, however, some differences among the copies of <i>1818</i> as a result of the formes having loosened or type having been broken during the printing process (see &quot;Emendations to and Anomalies in the <i>1818</i> Text&quot; below). All such variations as well as all printing errors and misspellings (but not variant spellings) are pointed out in the textual notes, thereby enabling me to produce an unemended literal transcript of <i>1818</i>, one that duplicates the first edition (in its hypothetically reconstructed complete state) as much as possible, although filtered through the following conventions:</p> <p><b>8.5-point CG Times:</b> The base font of 8.5-point CG Times is used to represent the text, but I also attempt to image print variations in <i>1818</i> by using such things as initial display type (e.g., Word) for the first word in each Chapter&mdash;as well as large and small Caps and even an 8-point font for portions of the letters Walton and others exchanged in the narrative.</p> <p><b>Lineation:</b> The <i>1818</i> text parallels the manuscript text, line by line, as much as space allows. When a manuscript word occupies the end of one line and the beginning of another, the <i>1818</i> word is represented on the first of these lines; when there are extensive revisions between <i>1816-17</i> Draft and <i>1818</i> (whether evident in extant <i>1817</i> Fair Copy or deducible as having taken place in now missing fair copy, proofs, and/or revises), the <i>1818</i> text will have fewer or more words occupying the available lines than is the case for</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
