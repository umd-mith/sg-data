\*There are two significant points about this quire, one of which
concerns its position in the files of deposited Abinger papers in the
Bodleian Library. All of Draft Notebook A up to and including folio 62
is part of the first Abinger file, Dep. c. 477/1; the remainder of
Notebook A (folios 1-11 and 12-17 together with folio 18, that slip of
paper linking Notebooks A and B) is part of Dep. c. 534/1 that also
contains Notebook B. One of the reasons for this division must have been
that Dep. c. 534/1, folio 1 (pages 161/1) begins "Vol. II" of the novel:
page 161 (a recto) is blank, and page 1 (a verso) begins the new
pagination sequence for Vol. II or what MWS initially designed as a
two-volume novel. Possibly related to the beginning of the new volume is
page 153 in this quire, which is interesting for a number of reasons: it
illustrates MWS's characteristic vertical cancel lines; the text was
canceled because it had originally concluded the narrative of Vol. I on
page "157"; what happened afterwards, as the Quiring Charts reveal, is
that MWS tore out two preceding leaves (the original and now missing
pages "153/154" and "155/156"), which she then rewrote and expanded on
four leaves (folios 59-62): that is, on eight pages (153/154, 155/156,
157/158, 159/160), the first of which was the original page "157" (which
she altered to page "153")â€”see transcription page 253 in this edition;
see also my remarks in "Hypothetically Reconstructing an Ur-Text of
*Frankenstein:* Chapters (or Characters and Incidents) after the
Creation."
