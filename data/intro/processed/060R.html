Krempe&quot; (page <i>55</i>); the professor &quot;M.W.&quot; first became &quot;Mr. Waldham&quot; and then &quot;M. Waldman&quot; (page 57 and note); &quot;Justine Martin&quot; became &quot;Justine Moritz&quot; (pages 127 and 133 and notes); the child &quot;Louisa M [or ?B]&quot; became &quot;Louisa [?Caln (or ?Valn)]&quot; became &quot;Louisa Biron&quot; (page 133); the pretty &quot;Miss Mansfeld&quot; became &quot;Miss Mansfield&quot; in <i>1818</i> without any evidence for the change in the Draft (pages 133 and 135); the rich banker &quot;M. Hofland&quot; became &quot;M. Duvillard&quot; in <i>1818</i> without any evidence for the change in the Draft (page 135); Victor&#39;s mother &quot;Caroline Beaumont&quot; became &quot;Caroline Beaufort&quot; in <i>1818</i> without any evidence for the change in the Draft (page 177). &quot;Biron&quot; of course echoes Byron, and &quot;Duvillard&quot; was the surname of MWS&#39;s Swiss maid Elise. All of the names in the novel, of course, have antecedents, and the name &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is no exception. Most often, it is linked by way of science and &quot;lightning&quot; to Benjamin Franklin, but Florescu (pages 58 ff.) has traced the name to the Castle Frankenstein in Germany that MWS and PBS and Claire Clairmont may have visited during their six weeks&#39; tour in 1814. This edition may make it possible for new research on all of the names in <i>Frankenstein</i>.<sup>37</sup></p> <p><b><i>Hypothetic ally Reconstructing an Ur-Text of</i> Frankenstein</b></p> <p>It is dangerous to speculate about the ur-text of <i>Frankenstein</i>, for it could have been very short and inconsequential; and it is possible, therefore, that everything mediating between such an ur-text and the Draft was nothing more than now discarded rough drafts of pages and sections that never had any integrity or identity as a separate text. However, there are clues in the Draft that MWS may have been copying from and expanding upon what she called her &quot;story&quot;&mdash;an ur-text of some length that she had written in the summer of 1816. The remarks on the names above suggest that Frankenstein spent his childhood with Myrtella and Carignan in that ur-text, and that maybe his mother&#39;s maiden name was Beaumont. However, it should be stressed that every changed name does not an ur-text character make. Other evidence suggests, e.g., that the very long chapter about &quot;Maimouna&quot; (who then became &quot;Amina&quot; and then &quot;Safie&quot;) was not drafted or even conceived until late November or early December 1816.</p> <p>It is easier to speculate about what was not in the ur-text than to prove what was there. One way for MWS to enlarge her &quot;story&quot; into a &quot;book&quot; or novel was to add new characters and incidents to the outside and to the inside of her frame tale. That is, it is likely that neither the Captain (Walton from the outside narrative frame) nor the Arabian (Safie from the innermost tale) was in the original ur-text&mdash;and there is no persuasive manuscript evidence to suggest that they were.<sup>38</sup> Whether the other parts of the De Lacey episode were contained in the ur-text, with a possibly different mechanism for the monster learning to speak and read, I cannot determine. Everything else, however, may have been sketched out in one form or another in the summer of 1816. MWS tells us that the tale began with the line &quot;It was on a dreary night of November.&quot; Reasoning from that fact, we can speculate that the ur-text had three distinct parts (although it is impossible to determine just how long each one was): the creation scene; the scenes before the creation; the scenes after the creation. Evidence for each of these parts in the ur-text comes from the following sources: (1) MWS&#39;s statements in her Journals, her letters, and her <i>1831</i> Introduction; (2) mistakes in transcription that are best explained as copying rather than drafting errors; (3) a Draft page or chapter that underwent only minimal cancelation and revision when it was initially drafted into the Notebook (suggesting that it was an intermediate Draft that had been copied from an earlier version); (4) a Draft page or chapter with relatively full and/or precise pointing, suggesting that MWS and/or PBS had worked through the punctuation in an earlier complete draft; and, finally, (5) references in a part of the ur-text (hypothetically reconstructed by means of the evidence</p> <p> </p> </body> </html>
