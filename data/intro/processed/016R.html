James Rieger. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press (Phoenix Edition), 1982. [This important edition (initially published in the Library of Literature, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1974) was the first to print a &quot;Collation of the Texts of 1818 and 1831&quot; and the first to record the autograph variants in <i>1818 Thomas</i> (which Rieger incorporated into the <i>1818</i> text). The 1974 edition was first reprinted (with different pagination and lineation) by New York: Pocket Books, 1976. The 1982 Chicago reprint, however, is to be preferred because it corrects &quot;minor errors in the introduction and apparatus&quot; and lists &quot;some additional 1818/1831 variants at the end of the volume&quot;&mdash;the &quot;Collation&quot; is printed on pages 230-259 and (288).]</p> <p>The copy of the first edition of <i>1818</i> (Pierpont Morgan Library, PML 16799) that MWS corrected, annotated, and presented to Mrs. Thomas in Genoa in [?July] 1823.</p> <p> </p> <p> <i>1818</i> <i>Wolf-1</i></p> <p><i>The Annotated Frankenstein.</i> (<i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley; Introduction and Notes by Leonard Wolf.)
