As positioned, each beta-radiograph shows the watermark-pattern as most intelligibly viewed, irrespective of its current position on the individual leaf. However, an attempt to describe the position of each watermark relative to its leaf (but not to its original whole sheet as manufactured) is made in the captions. These captions also distinguish by &quot;recto&quot; or &quot;verso&quot; the side of the leaf from which the watermark is to be viewed (further distinguished as the &quot;mould&quot; or &quot;felt&quot; side of the paper). [The concluding square brackets further identify the Notebook from which the leaf came, as well as the page number (in italics) in this edition where the photofacsimile of that recto or verso may be viewed.]</p> <p>There are three kinds of pairings in the sample beta-radiographs below: pairs where the bifolium contains two different watermarks, one on each side (see Figs. 7-8, where the once conjoint leaves have been separated); pairs where the fold of a bifolium splits a watermark into two halves (see Figs. 1-2 and 3-4, where leaves once conjoint were later separated by tearing across the watermark at the fold; and Figs. 10-11, where leaves once conjoint were later separated by cutting across the watermark near the fold); and artificially constructed pairs (see Figs. 12-13 for one watermark that is constructed from two leaves that were not originally conjoint; and see Figs. 5-6 for two watermarks that would ordinarily be divided by the fold of a bifolium but in this case are taken from two leaves that were not originally conjoint).</p> <p> Fig. 1.
