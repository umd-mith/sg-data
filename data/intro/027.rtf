In the case of \i Frankenstein, \i0 the substantive changes that MWS made in her revised edition are so extensive that many teachers and students of \i Frankenstein \i0 consider \i 1818 \i0 and \i 1831 \i0 as two different novels. Among the significant "alterations" made in \i 1831 \i0 are the following: a transformation of Elizabeth from a cousin to a foundling having no blood relation to Victor; a new chapter to accommodate a much longer exposition about Victor's childhood; and a more explicit and earlier introduction of the doppelganger theme when Victor alludes to Aristophanes' myth of the circular and then divided primal human beings in Plato's \i Symposium.\super 6\nosupersub  \i0 The already published collations between \i 1818 \i0 and \i 1831 \i0 provide an opportunity for any reader of \i Frankenstein \i0 to experience the creative process by which MWS transformed an already published edition into another text, and this edition of The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks extends that opportunity backwards: it publishes for the first time the extant portions of the \i 1816-17 \i0 Draft and the \i 1817 \i0 Fair Copy (both printed parallel to \i 1818) \i0 so that the reader can "see" the transformations of one text into another and, at the same time, "see" the degree of PBS's involvement in these transformations.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li0\fi360\ri0\sb0\sa0\sl-259\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 In addition to collations and parallel texts, there have been other studies that have addressed the texts of \i Frankenstein \i0 by way of the manuscripts, but each of these has been flawed, in one way or another, because the full texts of The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks, here published for the first time, were not available to benefit the earlier studies. As this edition will make evident, much of the criticism to date on \i Frankenstein \i0 will have to be re-evaluated in light of the collaboration between MWS and PBS, a collaboration that can now be "seen" in this edition by way of the different fonts used to distinguish the Shelleys' often similar manuscript hands. Those who have previously attempted to make those distinctions include James Rieger, E. B. Murray, Ann Mellor, Marie Helene Huet, and David Ketterer, each of whose contributions will be briefly addressed below in "MWS and PBS's Collaboration in The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks." Because so many critics of the novel have made factual errors (repeating, e.g., that \i Frankenstein \i0 was published in March 1818 rather than its actual publication date of 1 January 1818), I also refer the reader to the \i "Frankenstein \i0 Chronology" below for a record of the facts about the novel as they can best be determined. Some readers may prefer to go immediately to that Chronology in preparation for reading The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qc\li17\fi0\ri0\sb235\sa0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i\scaps\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs30 Using This Edition of The \i0 Frankenstein \i Notebooks}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li5\fi0\ri0\sb187\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 This edition of The \i Frankenstein \i0 Notebooks partakes of the characteristics of a diplomatic edition, that is, one that "doubles" or reproduces another text (whether printed or manuscript) with a fidelity that respects the original's spelling, punctuation, lineation, and other particulars so that the reader can re-experience, albeit in a different representational form, the original text. More precisely stated, however, this edition is made up of three separate editions: (1) a \i photo facsimile \i0 of the manuscript; (2) a \i type facsimile \i0 that replicates the manuscript (page by page, line by line, word by word); and \expndtw12 (3)\expndtw0  a \i "diplomatic\super 33\nosupersub  or literal transcript \i0 of the \i 1818 \i0 first edition that is printed in tandem with the type facsimile of the manuscript, providing the reader parallel texts by which the creative process may be studied. This combination of three editions\super 7\nosupersub  was made possible by three fortuitous circumstances: a Garland policy (worked out in collaboration with Donald H. Reiman and the Bodleian Library) to reproduce in photofacsimile all extant manuscript pages, each of which would be faced by a type facsimile; a set of \i Frankenstein \i0 manuscripts in which MWS managed to write fewer than ten words in each line; and a pre-determined Garland \expndtw19 9x12\expndtw0  inch format that could accommodate the manuscript}\par }
