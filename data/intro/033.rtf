Distinctions are made between \i top \i0 and \i upper \i0 (the former higher on the page), between \i bottom \i0 and \i lower \i0 (the former lower on the page), between \i above \i0 and \i below \i0 (referring to vertical positions on the page) and \i over \i0 and \i under \i0 (referring to words, letters, or marks that overlay or underlay others), between \i miswritten \i0 and \i misformed \i0 (the former usually referring to a misspelled word; the latter, to a misshaped letter), between \i bleed-through \i0 and \i show-through \i0 ink marks (both visible in the photofacsimiles, but the latter visible without the ink having bled through to the other side of the paper), and between \i wet-offset \i0 and \i dry-offset \i0 ink marks (the former evidencing an ink mark resulting from the closing of a still-wet inked page against another page; the latter, from a chemical process that sometimes causes dry ink from one leaf to "yellow" a facing leaf in a closed notebook). Economy has dictated such non-parallel phrasings as \i "misspelled \i0 word" and \i "variant spelling \i0 word" (in both cases "word" is the word as it appears in the manuscript, and "variant spelling" covers a multitude of spellings that are sanctioned in one form or another by the \i OED); \i0 the combined short and long "s" has been termed the \i "ligatured \i0 ss". Among the other types of notes are those addressing the condition of the paper (including such matters as soiling, discoloration, torn edges, holes, glue residue), the appearance of various marks (e.g., insert marks, carets, cancel lines), and the formation of certain letters or words (e.g., uncrossed t's, crossed l's, one letter or word overlaying another, and some initial letters like "o" that could be either capital or lower case).

Thus a word represented in the type facsimile as "allow^J" (indicating that PBS had added "ed" to MWS's "allow") would be described in the notes as \i "PBS \i0 ed \b\i added \b0 in \i0 allowed" (see also "MWS and PBS in Notes" above).

Because PBS undertook part of the fair copying (see pages 748-773 in this edition), these parallel texts in Appendix A provide the reader an opportunity to contrast the ways that MWS (see pages 780-810) and PBS (see pages 810-817) altered the Draft while transcribing the Fair Copy.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qc\li0\fi0\ri17\sb211\sa0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw-4\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs30 Appendix B}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li10\fi0\ri0\sb185\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs22 Appendix B prints in parallel form the texts of a portion of the PBS Fair Copy and the extant MWS re-transcription of that portion, a re-transcription occasioned by one or both of two factors: a discovery that some of the PBS Fair-Copy text had been damaged when the pages were cut from the notebook; and/or a possible reluctance to submit to any publisher (but especially to PBS's publisher Charles Oilier) the Fair Copy with parts\super 13\nosupersub  in PBS's distinctive hand, potentially revealing the identity of the anonymous author and "friend" whom PBS represented to the publishers.}\par }
