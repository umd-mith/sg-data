(Despite the fact that he liked the novel, Murray upon the advice of his chief adviser William Gifford (who was also editor of the \i Quarterly Review) \i0 had apparently decided not to purchase the copyright of \i Frankenstein, \i0 but he may have considered other options for the novel [e.g., an agreement for half- or third-profits\super 19\nosupersub ] until 18 June [see that date below].)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li0\fi0\ri22\sb264\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 18 June 1817 MWS entryin her^Marlow Journaljthat "Frank, sent back\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 send it to G."

(By sending the Fair-Copy Notebooks to Godwin, MWS may have been using him to seek yet another publisher, a possibility supported by there being no extant record about the novel for the next six weeks. Because Godwin read \i Frankenstein \i0 in proof in October and November 1817 [see 13 October and 22, 24 November 1817 below], he may not have actually read the novel in manuscript at this time in June; however, Claire Clairmont referred to a letter in which Mrs. Godwin apparently indicated that she had read the novel in manuscript\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 see Claire Clairmont to Edward John Trelawny, [?April 1871], \i Clairmont Correspondence, \i0 II, 617.)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li0\fi0\ri10\sb262\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 13 July 1817 MWS recorded in her Marlow Journal that PBS "tra[n]slates Promethes Desmotes and I write it" (MWS \i Journal, \i0 I, 177). The resulting translation of Aeschylus (as dictated by PBS to MWS) survives in Bodleian MS. Shelley adds. c. 5, folios 73-84 (see Barker-Benfield, \i Guitar, \i0 pages 88-89), in pages from a notebook identical to the one used for MWS's re-transcription of PBS's Fair Copy (see [? 10-13] May 1817 above) and almost identical to Fair-Copy Notebooks CI and C2 (see Introduction). (Because we do not know when MWS decided on the title or subtitle for her novel, it is possible that this translation of Aeschylus's \i Prometheus Bound \i0 had something to do with it, but it is equally or even more possible that she decided on this title back in 1816: she certainly knew the Promethean myth before 1816 by means of her father's book on mythology;\super 20\nosupersub  in 1816 she listed "Prometheus of Eschylus-Greek" as one of the volumes PBS read [see MWS \i Journal, \i0 I, \i 97], \i0 and she was almost certainly familiar with Byron's "Prometheus," the ode he wrote in July or August 1816\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 PBS apparently translated Aeschylus for Byron before he wrote his ode, which Claire Clairmont then fair copied [see \i Byron Works, \i0 IV, 457].)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li5\fi0\ri0\sb259\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 3 August 1817 PBS from Marlow asked his publisher Charles Oilier to publish \i Frankenstein \i0 in the following letter: "I send you with this letter a manuscript which has been consigned to my care by a friend in whom I feel considerable interest.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 I do not know how far it consists with your plan of business to purchase the copyrights, or a certain interest in the copyrights of any works which should appear to promise success.
