I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, to my husband, and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world" (page xi). Without further evidence, it is impossible to determine the nature and length of the ur-text: was it that MWS (1) merely \i "thought \i0 but of a few pages\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 of a short tale [my italics]" and then, after writing just "a few pages," quickly turned to the greater length of a novel, even as early as July? or did she (2) write an ur-text of 30 or 50 or more pages in June, July, and possibly even August\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\f2\cchs0 \'97\hich\af0\dbch\af2\loch\f0\cchs0 and then turn to Notebook A to rewrite and expand the ur-text into a longer novel?

MWS seems to be very specific in her entries, especially during the period of 1816-18, carefully choosing such words as "write," "read," "copy," "transcribe," and "translate." Although the word "work" could denote yet another kind of literary activity [such as taking notes for current or future projects], I am confident that "work" actually refers to some of the \i physical \i0 work that any person in a household would do at this time: consider, for example, the Journal entry of "make jellies}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li14\fi0\ri17\sb0\sa0\sl-259\slmult0\tx259 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 6{\charscalex100\expndtw0\tab }work" in a cumulative entry for 27-31 July 1817 \i [MWS Journal, \i0 1,177]; also consider the entries elsewhere in\line this "\i Frankenstein \i0 Chronology."\super 13\nosupersub )}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li0\fi0\ri0\sb257\sa0\sl-257\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i0\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 25, 26 September 1816 MWS twice entered in her Bath Journal that she and PBS did "talk of our plans" (MWS \i Journal, \i0 I, 137), which might have included plans for writing \i Frankenstein. \i0 (MWS entries of "Work" or "work" on 26, 27, and 28 September probably referred to non-literary physical work rather than to the writing of \i Frankenstein.)}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\ql\li26\fi0\ri0\sb281\sa0\tx202 \f2\fs20{\b0\i\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 7{\charscalex100\expndtw0\tab }\i0 October 1816       MWS entry of "write" in her Bath Journal most likely refers to her story or novel \i Frankenstein.}\par \pard \plain \cbpat8\qj\li19\fi0\ri2\sb259\sa0\sl-262\slmult0 \f2\fs20{\b0\i\cf1\charscalex100\expndtw0\dn0\f2\cchs0\lang1033\langfe1033\fs20 9 \i0 October 1816 MWS's half-sister Fanny Imlay Godwin committed suicide.
